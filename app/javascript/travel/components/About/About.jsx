    <h2>From Daniel</h2>
    <p>
      If you're here, you probably know me. If not, hi - I'm Daniel Patterson a
      26 year old software developer currently travelling in South East Asia and
      South America for six months with my girlfriend, Rosie.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is essentially:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>My diary</li>
      <li>A way of letting friends & family know what I'm up to</li>
      <li>A way of making sure I don't become too rusty a programmer over the next six months</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The site and it's content will hopefully be significantly updated over the coming months as I
      write more diary entries and add more functionality.
    </p>

So, better write this down before I forget it all. I started in Edinburgh,
finishing moving out of my flat by shoving the last few things into my parents'
car (with their help). We managed to squeeze into the jam-packed car to go and
say goodbye to my granny before heading to the airport.

We arrived with over two hours to spare - plenty of time. I tried to check in my
bag through the automated machines (human contact? Not for this software
developer), but it wasn't having any of it. I managed to check in at the manned
desk, but apparently could only get my boarding pass for my first of three
flights (to Manchester). My bag, however, was given passage all the way to
Bangkok.

The flight to Manchester was fine and I was told that I'd be able to pick up my
remaining boarding passes at the gate for my next flight. I passed a couple of
hours programming in a restaurant (chosen because it had a few plug sockets) and
eating a surprisingly good lamb tagine.

When my gate was announced, I packed up, found the gate, and asked the staff for
my boarding cards. They found them and were about to hand them over when one
asked to see my ticket for my onwards journey from Thailand, apparently
necessary before being let into the country. Cue a look of _hopefully_ mild
confusion while my stomach lurches - Rosie and I were planning to leave Thailand
by bus which can only be booked in person in Chiang Mai. Damn.

One of the members of staff recommended a website to book cheap bus tickets, but
it only covered Cambodia. Improvising, I tried to look for flights from Chiang
Mai to Luang Prabang in Laos, near to the next stop on our itinerary. The
airport wifi suddenly seemed so much slower as soon as I needed it to work.
Luckily, Rosie phoned to check how the first leg of my journey was going and I
told her what had happened. Because both my internet connection and the queue to
board the plane was dwindling to nothing, Rosie found and booked both of us on a
flight to Luang Prabang. Unfortunately, there weren't many left and we would
have to fly through Bangkok. Worse, the confirmation email was just a proof of
purchase, not a booking. The booking email would be sent "within the next four
hours". Great.

Thankfully, the airline officials accepted the proof of purchase email. I was
the last to get on the plane and my heart rate returned to normal. I sat back,
relaxed, watched some crappy superhero movie until the in-air entertainment
system failed and I managed to get some sleep (thank you, travel pillow).

I woke up feeling slightly worse than when I went to sleep, as expected from
plane sleep. Once I'm off the plane I connected to the wifi to check that
nothing else had gone wrong. Getting stuck in Manchester would have been
frustrating, but in Abu Dhabi it'd have been down right awkward. Once connected,
a stream of messages popped up. Uh oh. The last-minute flight was never booked,
there weren't enough places, so it was cancelled. Didn't they know that
when we booked? Terrible user experience. Bad software design was quite possibly
the cause. But most importantly, it once again left me without a ticket out of
Thailand.

Rosie to the rescue again! She booked a flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, a
week and a half later. That was a much better idea than my rushed earlier
attempt. We were planning to return to Thailand later and would have to have
another proof of exit; that flight could be used as proof of exit both times.

After another flight with a bad superhero movie and worse sleep, I made it to
Bangkok. I got my luggage, found the train into the city and got off near the
centre. After half an hour of wandering around I figured the connecting train
shown on Google Maps at the airport may no longer exist. Admittedly, there had
been a warning saying that the schedule may be out of date.

I wasn't totally sure just how far it would be to walk to my hotel and may have
been a _little_ intimidated by the idea of trying to cross the incredibly busy
roads. When a taxi stopped, I told him where I was going and accepted the
rip-off fare because I really just wanted to get some decent sleep. I got to the
hotel, checked in, messaged home and Rosie to say I'd made it, then went to
sleep.

I woke up at 4am Bangkok time, 11am UK time. That was probably jet lag. I've yet
to experience jet lag particularly badly - I just rolled over, went back to
sleep and woke up again six hours later.

Our booking included breakfast, so I helped myself to pastries, jam, orange
juice and a bowl of cornflakes. The milk was definitely UHT but I happen to
think that one of the two ways UHT milk tastes good is on cornflakes (the other,
obviously, being drunk straight from the 5ml plastic containers that are
_possibly_ intended to be used for take away tea & coffee).

I spent the next couple of hours reading the Bangkok section of our guidebook
and a bit of the cookery-slanted South East Asia travel book I was reading.
Rosie arrived in the early afternoon, dumped her stuff, showered, and we headed
out into Bangkok.

To get a bit of background on Thailand, we went to the guidebook-recommended
Museum of Siam. The museum was primarily focussed on trying to determine "What
is Thainess", highlighting the importance of the nation, religion and monarchy
to its people. The exhibits in each of the 17 rooms were different in style,
quite interactive and (mostly) in English. For me, the best and strangest room
was the one trying to determine how Thai certain outfits were by ranking them in
a pyramid formation. Some of these seemed clear after earlier parts of the
museum, such as Rama being the most Thai and formal Thai costume being fairly
high up. But what are "Bike for Mom" and "Bike for Dad" t-shirts and why are
they even higher? I'm pretty sure I'd never see a similar display in a British
museum - I doubt there is a politically-correct way to determine how British
something is, especially in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Afterwards, we made our way back to our hotel, the Hotel Royal Bangkok. It was
on one of the main streets of Chinatown, blazing with the neon glow from the
multitude of signs. It turned out our hotel was bang in the centre of the street
food stalls in Chinatown, making it perfect for dinner. We wandered around to
choose a few, settling on shredded duck rolls, deep-fried vegetable spring
rolls and surprisingly good deep-fried noodles & sweet chilli dip. We also got
got several things from a man frying small bundles of food wrapped in bacon and
served on cocktail sticks, mainly different types of mushrooms but also some
tasty asparagus.

We finished the day with a cocktail each in the rooftop bar of our hotel.
Apparently it was a pool party but everyone seemed to be ignoring both the pool
and the blaring music. The night skyline of Bangkok, however, was spectacular.

To try and capitalise on our (Rosie's) jet lag, we got up at 6.45am to get out
early. Unfortunately, we lost a bit of time booking the train for Chiang Mai the
next day, but then went down to breakfast. I tried out some of the Thai food on
offer - rice and several stews with some chilli sauce.

Today was our day for seeing some of the main recommended sights of Bangkok -
the Grand Palace and Wat Pho. The Grand Palace is a former residence of the Thai
monarchy and also houses the Emerald Buddha (which isn't made from emerald). The
palace complex is huge and the buildings are incredibly ornate and covered in
gold. For me, the most interesting (and least crowded) parts were Chakri
Mahaprasat - a Western-style building with a Thai roof - and a smaller museum of
items donated to the Buddha, which includes models of what the complex looked
like when it was built in 1782 and what it is like now.

We then went to Wat Pho, a temple with a huge reclining Buddha, more intricate
decorations and a functioning primary school. It was recommended more than the
Grand Palace primarily for its impressive Buddha and smaller crowds, but the
significantly cheaper entry price and free water were greatly appreciated.

We haggled our way onto a tuk tuk to Siam Square and bought lunch at the food
court in the huge MBK centre. From there, we caught the Skytrain (similar to
the subway, but built at a level **above** the cars) to Chatuchak weekend
market. The market was _huge_, a maze of stalls selling anything and
everything, from a plethora of tourist tat to pet cats.

Somewhat overwhelmed and overheated, we settled down by a lake in an adjacent
park to relax for a bit. We were facinated and somewhat revolted by the size of
the catfish which fought over the food being thrown into the lake by people near
by. After a while, we made our way back to the hotel on the subway. We finished
off the night with street food and chilling in the rooftop bar.

Trying to keep the early mornings going, we woke up at 6.45am again. After
breakfast, we packed up & checked out of the hotel, leaving our bags there. We
spent the morning pootering up and down the river on the public boats - a cheap
and effective means of seeing the city from the water. The boats are long and
thin - significantly longer than the boarding piers. The entry and exit of the
boat is at the rear, so the driver cannot position it easily. To help, each of
the boats has a member of staff at the rear with a whistle to communicate with
the driver. They produced a whole raft of different noises for various different
situations, all of which easily cut through the low-pitched engine noises. (I'm
aware that "driver"and "rear" are unlikely to be the correct terms when on a
boat, but I find them clearer because they're more general).

We then briefly went to see a reasonably low-key buddhist shrine, at least, in
comparison to the temples the day before. We had lunch in an enormous food court
and tried to make our way to Jim Thompson's house. Jim Thompson was an American
architect turned soldier posted to Thailand at the end of WWII who became a silk
trader and possibly CIA agent. His house was an iteresting mix of Thai and
european architecture and art.

We finished the day by picking up our bags and catching the sleeper train to
Chiang Mai. As I finish writing this, we've just had our curtained-off semi
compartment changed from two seats and a table into bunk beds and the air
conditioning is so strongs I'm cold for the first time since I arrived.

We were woken up at about 6.30 am by the conductor announcing over the tannoy
that they needed to change our beds back into seats. We watched the sun rise as
the train pulled into Chiang Mai station, then packed up and left.

Chiang Mai is significantly smaller and noticeably cooler (at least in the
morning) than Bangkok. It still has the moat and some of the walls of the
original city, which we drove past to our hotel. We dropped off our bags, signed
up for a trip the next day and headed out to see some temples.

After Bangkok, we both knew we were pretty close to being templed out. However,
Chiang Mai has a lot of temples, they're mostly free and don't require booking.
We slowly wandered around as the day got hotter, admiring the architecture and
several groups of topiary animals.

Everything was cheaper in Chiang Mai, too - from the taxi to the food. The city
clearly depends on tourism and the museum explaining the history of the area was
very well done. A lot of it focussed on the founding of the city, whereas the
annexation of the former kingdom of Lanna by Siam was stated briefly towards the
end.

We rounded off the day by spending quite a bit of time booking our next few
places to stay and transport between them - unfortunately necessary during a
long trip. We grabbed dinner at a near by night food market which had some
great-tasting food. I love banana pancakes, so had to try the "banana roti with
Milo" - an interpretation of the Indian flatbread roti filled with banana and
fried, then layered with condensed milk and Milo (a malted chocolate drink
powder). Definitely something I'll have a go at making!

Today we went on a tour organised through our hotel. It was an all-in-one kind
of deal - see a couple of waterfalls, the highest point in Thailand, a couple of
chedis, lunch, visit a couple of local tribes. Basically, we got on
a minibus, drove around quite a bit, got off for half an hour here and there to
take pictures, then back on the bus. Thrilling.

We both realised this sort of activity isn't really for us. We'd rather see only
the sites we find interesting (mainly the scenery) and be able to stop at things
we only glimpsed out the window, like the flower farms. The obligitory market
stops were no where near as informative a view on local life as the museum
yesterday was. The repeated grumblings from the three people in the back seat
who'd been told incorrectly that they could go swimming didn't really brighten
the bus journey back.

Some of the sights were impressive, though, particularly the view from the
chedis (or pagodas). It was interesting to learn that they had been constructed
by the Thai Air Force, but we were unable to learn why particularly they built
them, other than in honour of the king and queen's birthdays.

This was probably the best day so far. Straight after breakfast we were picked
up and went to Asia Scenic cooking school. Maybe that breakfast was a bad idea.

We teamed up with a mixed group of ten other people and each chose seven
different recipes to make over the day. We donned strikingly pink aprons, toured
a local garden and market to learn more about specific Thai ingredients, then
headed back to the kitchen.

It was fun, informative and the food was informative. Rosie and I made
completely different recipes, so we got the opportunity to taste plenty of new
things. Rosie learnt how to make a delicious northern Thai curry she'd had the
day before, Khaw Soi, and I got quite a bit of two deserts, deep fried banana
and blue sticky rice with mango. I really enjoy making curry, so it was great to
get to make and try several curry pastes. Best of all, I'm pretty sure most of
the ingredients will be available in Edinburgh (somewhere) - I want to learn
things that I can make at home.

Funnily enough we didn't need dinner. We had a wander through the night market
so Rosie could buy some Thai thousers (Thaits?) and - shock horror - it actually
rained! At least, enough water fell from the sky for two minutes to prompt the
stall keepers to put out shelters, then the rain promptly stopped.

Today was a bit more chilled out it more ways than one. Primarily we didn't have
anything booked, but in addition the temperature had dropped to about 18°C.

We spent the morning wandering through Chiang Mai with the aim of booking
tomorrow's activities, our onwards transport, and most importantly, scoping out
afternoon tea. Several of the more expensive hotels ($300 a night rather than
our $20 a night place) offer afternoon tea, complete with an "artistic tower of
sweet and savoury temptations". We ended up at 2pm on the riverside balcony of
the Anantara hotel with tea, scones, about fifteen different snacks and a
milkshake each. Admittedly, the milkshake probably works a lot better at the
more normal temperatures of 25-35 degrees.

The main activity today was going to meet some elephants. It's a popular thing to do in Chiang Mai
and was really interesting. There are loads of places that do it with very similar descriptions so
we'd spent some time having a look for one with good reviews that didn't include anything else
(unlike our first tour).

We were picked up by a songthaew at 7am and driven, along with six other tourists, two hours out of
the city. A songthaew is one of the many adaptations of the Thai pickup truck - in this case, it's a
standard pickup with a roof over the back and a bench along each wall. I'm sure the breeze in the
open back is normally both refreshing and exhilirating, but unfortunately the weather wasn't any
better than yesterday so we were all soon pretty cold.

Once we got to the elephants, the day got better. There were two of them, both very calm but also
impressive. We fed them sugar cane which allowed them to show their ingeniuity - the male, Jimmy,
stuffed a bit of sugar cane behind his tusk to maximise the amount he could get while storing some
for later. We then walked for about ten to twenty minutes to a river where we (mainly Rosie) gave
the elephants a mud bath, covering them in mud, then throwing water at them when they went into the
river.

We were pretty tired once we got back to Chiang Mai. We had thought about going to a temple out of
town that supposedly was a great viewpoint, but it was still very cloudy so we opted for a walk
around the city walls. We ended up chilling beside a pond in a park with a couple of ice creams,
followed up an hour later by a surprisingly large banana milkshake (served in a jug, not a glass).

By chance, one of Rosie's friends from our halls in St Andrews, Tara, happened to have arrived in
Chiang Mai within the last day or two. We met up for dinner today with her and her boyfriend to
catch up. They'd been travelling for the past two or three months in many of the countries we are
about to go to, so gave us plenty of tips. We had a great meal swapping stories, then headed back to
pack up, ready for our bus in the morning.

I wasn't particularly looking forward to this morning. There's something about a six-hour bus
journey in the immediate future that just hints that it's not going to be a great day. However, the
bus was actually pretty decent - a reclining seat (including leg rest), free snack & water, and an
on-board toilet. We also spent the journey listening to a fairly intense part of the Wheel of Time
series, which made the time fly.

Up next was the Laos border crossing, 4km from the bus stop. That required a tuk tuk ride, a $35
dollar fee & passport photo for a visa, an extra $1 becausse it's the weekend and a songthaew 10km
to the town we're staying in (Huay Xai).

Negotiating the songthaew took quite a long time because we had to do it with the four other
tourists who had just crossed the border. We all had different anounts of different currencies and
different ideas of what was a good deal. The driver spoke very little English and kept changing
between giving prices in Thai baht and Lao kip. After everyone was somewhat happy, we were on our
way - on the *right* side of the road. In Thailand, they drive on the left.

We found our hotel, dumped our stuff, got money, booked our bus away in three days and checked in
with our reason for being here - the Gibbon Experience, which we start tomorrow. Finished
organising, we found a riverside restaurant to eat, read, and enjoy the sunset over the Mekong
river.

This was the day I was looking forward to most, at least within the first few weeks of our trip. We
had booked the Gibbon Experience - three days spent in the jungle trying to spot wild gibbons,
sleeping in treehouses and ziplining between them. For quite a long time I've had a semi-serious
running joke that ziplines should be used in more places as a form of transport - I think they lend
themselves equally well to areas with tall buildings or large hills, plus they are far more
enjoyable than other means of transport.

Anyway, I'm getting a bit distracted. We dropped off our stuff at the main office, had a rushed
breakfast, watched a safety video, then crammed into a tiny songthaew with four other people. It
turned out being packed together so tight probably made it easier to stay in the back without
getting bounced out. After an hour and a half on tarmac, we stopped, picked up a few dozen eggs and
a can of beer for those that wanted it, then drove through a river onto an incredibly bumpy dirt
track for 40 minutes. The beers were gone fast - every bump of the road caused them to froth more
and more out of the can.

After having lunch in the village we stopped at, we trekked up through the jungle to a couple of
huts and some locals playing a game somewhere between volleyball and football. We collected our
harnesses and the group of 20 was divided into treehouse groups. Rosie and I ended up with four
others heading for treehouse seven.

In our smaller group, we made our way to our treehouse both by walking and by zipline. The wires
were rigged in such a way that they eliminated some parts of the path, with one zipline out and
another nearby for the journey back.

The flights themselves were fantastic. Spectacular views of the jungle both near and far, hundreds
of metres long and many over a hundred metres high. Each was slightly different in terms of speed
towards the end, so we had to hold our feet up to try and go faster or squeeze a bit of old tire
around the wire above us to act as a brake. Sometimes I wouldn't quite make it to the end, so would
have to grab the wire and haul myself hand-over-hand to the end. After getting off, we had to hit
the wire three times in a row to send a signal to the other side, letting them know it was safe to
go.

The final zipline was to our treehouse. It was 25 metres from the ground, or at least, to the bottom
storey (landing platform, toliet and shower). The middle storey was the largest, with space for four
double mattresses & mosquito nets, a large, low table, ten stools and a sink with running drinking
water. The top storey was about five metres up, a little crow's nest with a single mattress to sit
on.

We revelled in the view. We had a spectacular view down the valley, surrounded completely by jungle.
The sun was setting just out of sight behind the trees as we took it in turns to have a shower -
surprisingly, the shower was the place with the best view in the treehouse. It was amazing, at least
until plunging into the freezing shower water.

Our dinner arrived by zipline - there was a small collection of huts nearby that served as our
kitchen, with five or six people living there, including our two guides (at least for these two
nights). It was delicious and plentiful, with four different dishes along with sticky rice and tiny
oranges to follow.

We ended the night swapping magic tricks and card games with our guides, primarily "magic" Mike (or
"monkey" Mike as he also told us to call him). We played spoons, which was great fun, but probably
scared away any interesting animals. I learnt a new game, called "game".

## Rules to "Game"

*Decks*: 1 or 2
*Players*: 4+, in pairs

* Each pair decides on a secret signal to give when one of them has 4 of a kind
* Pairs sit opposite each other in the circle
* Each player is dealt 4 cards by the dealer
* One player in each pair looks at their hand, then gives it to their partner
* The partner chooses any 4 out of the 8 cards they hold to keep, then returns the remaining 4
* The dealer deals 4 cards face up in the centre of the table, then counts to hree out loud
* All players grab up to two cards that they need to form 4 of a kind, then discard into the middle
* Once no one wants to swap cards with the middle, the dealer replaces the middle cards & counts
* Once a player has 4 of a kind, they make the signal to their partner
* The _partner_ then can say "game", ending the round, scoring 1 point for that pair
* Alternatively, the partner can try and also get 4 of a kind, then say "double game", scoring 2
* However, if another player sees the secret signal and says "stop the game", the pair scores -1
* The first pair to 5 wins

Sleeping in a treehouse has its ups and downs. Sunset - definite up. Rats and squirrels in the
night, however, don't improve my sleep. We'd stored all our food in a box, but the giant black
squirrels were happy enough to scurry over our treehouse, pick off bark from the tree, squeaking all
the while. Coupled with the snoring of one of our treehouse-mates, Rosie and I didn't sleep
particularly well either night in treehouse seven.

After a delicious breakfast, we zipped and walked to treehouse one to try and spot gibbons. It was
the biggest treehouse, sprawling across two trees and at least four levels. Unfortunately we didn't
see any gibbons (apart from in a video on one of the guides' phones), so we zipped home for lunch.

The afternoon was more focused on ziplining than wildlife. We visited three other treehouses,
including treehouse five, almost 50 metres from the ground (apparently the world's highest). At
another, we saw a bright green snake very slowly moving along a branch of an adjacent tree. We spent
quite a bit of time at a tree which was the centre of a figure of 8 made up from four ziplines,
flying from the tree to the ground, walking a bit up hill, then zipping back to the tree. The height
that we had to walk up to be able to zip hundreds of metres was surprisingly little. I definitely
think they should be used in more places ...

We woke up to another cloudy morning, leaving an atmospheric (pardon the pun) fog in the valley
below the treehouse as it burnt off. We packed up, had another great breakfast (bread and tamarind &
coconut jam), took a final photo of our treehouse, then headed back down to the village we had
started at.

It was another bumpy drive back to the main road, where we stopped for lunch. We found out that a
couple of other people from our treehouse were also headed to Luang Prabang by overnight bus.
They'd already taken the bus once and were full of stories about how awful it was. Windy roads,
a cramped bed shared with another passenger, frequent stops, jammed full with people sleeping in the
aisle ... but ift hey were getting it again, it can't have been _that_ bad, can it?

Back in Huay Xai at the main office, we killed a couple of hours showering, repacking and reading by
the side of the Mekong river. At 5pm, slightly apprehensive about the night ahead, we got in a
songthaew to the bus station. The bus was there and apparently different from the sleeping bus we'd
been told about, possibly better.

Unfortunately, it wasn't. We both had something between a seat and a bed with seatbelts that didn't
work and after a huge number of locals piled into the bus we had someone practically sleeping on our
feet. The driver took off, turning off the lights, but making liberal use of his horn. The road
wasn't massively windy, but the stops did seem to be located about two minutes before I would
otherwise have been able to get to sleep. We did, however, manage to finish listening the the third
last Wheel of Time book. Only about 80 hours to go!

We woke up (if you can call the brief spells of unconsciousness the night before "sleep") at 5.30am
as the bus arrived. We shared a songthaew into town, dropped off our bags at our guest house, then
walked into the centre.

One of the main things to do in Luang Prabang, apparently, is to watch the alms giving at dawn. As I
was told by culturally insensitive American who wishes to remain nameless, alms giving is distinct
from thanksgiving by the lack of turkey. It also involves considerably more Buddhist monks. It was
as described - lines of monks walking the main street, being given food by others and photographed
by tourists.

We managed to find somewhere opening for breakfast, then went to the UXO information centre. "UXO"
is short for UneXploded Ordinance - a problem that Laos, the most heavily bombed country in the
world, suffers from daily. It was a fascinating, if harrowing, exhibition.

We were then able to check in to our guest house and use the wifi to decide on what to do for the
rest of the day. We found somewhere with a great sounding lunch that didn't disappoint, then caught
another songthaew, then boat, to a nearby waterfall. Because it's the dry season, the waterfall
wasn't particularly impressive, but we were able to have a bit of a (chilly) swim.

Back in Luang Prabang, we waited for the sunset beside the Mekong, then wandered through the night
market. We weren't massively hungry, but coudn't say no to some street food. By far the best were
some small coconut pancakes / dumplings made in large dishes with ladle-sized indents, similar to
Dutch pancakes but far more moist.

Returning early to our room, we caught up with home, work and sleep, despite thin walls and the
dulcet tones of a guitar-playing fellow guest.

Sleeping in a bit meant that we had a rushed morning to make our 9am cooking class on time.
Unfortunately, this one didn't quite live up to our previous experience. The market visit was
interesting, both to see what's available and the condition it's sold in (plenty of flies around the
meat ...). At the restaurant, we had to decide, in our group of nine, which six dishes to make out
of 27. We shared the prep of all the ingredients, then one person was assigned a recipe to a person
to cook. We then ate all of the food together.

Together, this meant we made very little ourselves and weren't really able to experiment with
flavours as we had been before. However, I did learn quite a bit more about how rice, particularly
sticky rice, is used in Laos, and got to try, if not make, rice cakes and rice "whiskey".

Fairly full, we made our way back to the guest house and, because it had come up in conversation,
took some Myers-Briggs personality tests. These weren't very revealing - they all agreed I'm
introverted (shock!), but over three tests I was assigned different results for the other three
categories.

After that short interval, we tried to catch the sunset from the stupa on the hill in the centre of
Luang Prabang. The hill is about around 300 steps to the top and has various Buddhist temple
buildings on it. As we discovered, at sunset it also has  hundreds of people crammed onto the peak.
We decided to skip the crowds, so wentlower and still got a decent view.

We returned to the night market and sat in a restaurant near the food part which had its own bakery
stall outside. We tried black rice wine with and without lime juice - a surprisingly good addition.
I also discovered their banana and avocado smoothie, almost chocolaty in its creaminess. I
definitely need to replicate that if possible.

After a proper lie in (to 9.15), we got up in time to make proper use of the guesthouse breakfast,
not just rush through it. Our plan for the rest of the day was to visit Kuang Si waterfall, which
seemed to be _the_ main attraction in Luang Prabang. At least, every time we walked past a tuk tuk
or songthaew driver their standard question was simply "Waterfall?".

We wandered up to one of the main places to find tuk tuks, haggling with a few. We knew it was
cheaper to share the 27km journey with others, so wanted to find drivers with other people heading
that way. After a few minutes, one guy said that he could find us one to share and brought us to his
friend's almost full Toyota Commuter (not as common as in Thailand, but still _everywhere_). This
seems to be a common way of doing things in Laos - lots of drivers and stall owners seem to work
together, sharing business so that the person who can most easily provide the goods or service does
and presumably the group benefits.

The waterfall was fun and quite impressive, particularly given that we've now seen quite a few in
quick succession. We walked up to the top, had a go on a swing only just above a pool at the top
(and ended up with wet feet). After an ice cream lunch we had  a bit of a swim in one of the
"refreshing" pools below the main falls.

Also contained within the waterfall park area was a "Free the Bears" moon bear rescue centre. Fairly
large black bears, their bile is apparently highly prized for its restorative powers. There were
about a dozen bears and cubs in enclosures, rescued from bile farms or from being kept as pets. It
was hard to tell exactly what the intent of the sanctuary was - there didn't seem to be much said
about releasing the bears, but neither were they really being used as a tourist attraction, given
that entrance was free after paying to get in to the waterfall park.

Back in Luang Prabang, we had the best meal of our trip so far. It was in a small restaurant on the
main street, specialising in a fusion of French and Lao cuisine. I had laap - a traditional local
salad made from minced chicken, plenty of herbs, spring onions and fried garlic - followed by slow
cooked pork belly, rice, banana flower, carrots and lemongrass. Rosie had a trio of dips followed
by a Thai shrimp bisque. I normally don't like bisque, but the creaminess combined with a lot of the
flavours we've been having in local food and cooking with was amazing.

Today was a travelling day, so not much to report. We were up early (5.30am) to get to the airport
for about 6.15 for our 7.40 flight. The airport was tiny - there were _maybe_ three other people
going through security. The only (minor) excitement was that I found the key to our hotel room in my
pocket. Damn.

We flew back into Bangkok and caught a six hour bus to Trat. We're just spending a night in Trat on
our way to Koh Mak, an island nearby. We managed to avoid a brief deluge, getting into our guest
house minutes before it started. Afterwards we sampled many different small dishes at the local
night market, including (of course) another load of delicious deep fried foods - spring rolls, tofu,
and noodles. In some ways it's not healthy, but food that we see being deep fried is probably less
likely to give us food poisoning. That, and it's incredibly good with the variety of sweet chilli
sauces here.

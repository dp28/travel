  We got up a little later than we meant to today, so decided to go for the
  shorter of the walks Rosie had found. We had our hostel breakfast and I tried
  to use up some not-so-nice South American Dairy Milk (made in Uruguay, I
  think) by putting it in porridge. I really don't recommend that - stirring it
  in a bit just accentuated the nastier tastes in the chocolate, not its
  creaminess. However, the bits that weren't stirred in were pockets of melted
  chocolate, which was decent.

  Rosie got a travel card from the hostel which we then topped up with money so
  that we could get some buses - they don't take cash. After some discussion, we
  got some crackers, a soft cheese and a packet of cookies for lunch, then
  caught the bus to the foothills of the Andes.

  We followed a gravel track up a mountain which stayed pretty flat for a long
  while then became steep. The mountain is definitely a foothill - only 1675m
  and we probably started at 1000m or higher. Still, it was pretty steep and the
  ground in front where Mendoza is built is very flat, so the view was great,
  especially with the Andes behind it. Until we saw it from there, neither of us
  had really appreciated how big Mendoza is.

  There wasn't too much in the way of wildlife, this being essentially a desert.
  We saw several large birds and I almost stepped on a tiny snake right at the
  start, but otherwise saw very little.

  We caught the bus back and got off near(ish) the big San Martin park to climb
  the smaller hill there. We had a decent view of the mountain we climbed with
  the Andes in the background (but into the sun, so the photos probably aren't
  great). We spent a bit of time at the independence memorial at the top, then
  walked back into town.

  It was between 6pm and 7pm at this point and I was pretty hungry, but
  typically people don't eat here until after 8.30pm - 9pm. However, we came
  across a restaurant (another Italian place) offering 40% off before 8.30pm,
  so they definitely wanted us to eat. Like everywhere else, it was starting to
  open and was practically deserted.

  The food was fantastic - warm bread, nice oil and vinegar, incredibly juicy
  burrata and slow roasted tomatoes and rich, cheesy baked pasta dishes. Our
  waiter was also really good, replacing our bread whenever it was done and
  helping us find a half bottle of wine we'd like. We left very full, but happy.
  <R> Guys the burrata was just amazing! </R>

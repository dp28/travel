:entry: "We had an early breakfast at around 7am this morning in order to catch our\nflight
  to Kuala Lumpur. We got a Grab to the airport, <R> passing a rainbow pangolin\nstatue
  at the airport (there are also animal statues on all of the roundabouts \nwhich
  are pretty cool ). </R>\nUnsurprisingly, the airport was pretty small. The flight
  was a couple of hours\nand uneventful, and as it was internal there wasn't much
  faff at either end.\nWe got the bus in to KL and walked a bit over a mile to our
  hostel.\n\nAfter a quick lunch of Thai food, we went back to the hostel and had
  a look\nat what we could do that afternoon, quickly discovering that the wifi was\npretty
  much inaccessible from our room. Damn, we'd been counting on it being\ndecent so
  we could do onward planning.\n\nWe walked across town to a street well known for
  its restaurants and street\nfood for dinner. Rosie had a great chicken satay and
  I had bits of chicken\nand veg served in a wide ring of deep fried yam.\n\nAfter
  eating, we continued down the street, finding ourselves being directed\nto the sides
  of a street while a dragon dance was set up (presumably as part\nof Chinese new
  year celebrations? - it was 15 days ago...). There was a small\nstage on a corner
  of the street and somewhat out of the blue the announcer\nthere welcomed \"Michael
  Jackson\" to the stage. This turned out to be a thin\nasian guy in a bright red
  suit dancing along to Despacito, occassionally\nsinging a couple of the words. <R>
  I'm pretty sure that we knew more of the words\nthan he did. </R> The dragon dance
  prep seemed forgotten and\npeople were allowed back onto the street. It became more
  bizarre when\nfireworks suddenly went off on the next street over, right beside
  a large\nhigh-rise building, within a few metres of its windows.\n\nWe left soon
  after \"Michael\" stopped his performance and the dragon dance\nstarted as the press
  of people meant we couldn't really see. We headed to\nKLCC park beside the Petronas
  Towers where there was a water and light show\nset to music. It was essentially
  a large number of fountains within a small\nlake near the Petronas Towers. Each
  fountain had a light under it shining up\nthrough the stream of water and would
  change colour through the full spectrum.\nThere were hundreds of them, forming elaborate
  patterns and colour sequences.\nThis apparently lasts two or three hours, with music
  accompanying it for about\nfive minutes every half hour. It was an impressive show,
  but after about 45\nminutes we headed back to sleep.\n"

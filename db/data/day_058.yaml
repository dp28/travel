  We had an early breakfast at around 7am this morning in order to catch our
  flight to Kuala Lumpur. We got a Grab to the airport, passing a pangolin
  statue on one of the roundabouts (there are animal statues on all of them).
  Unsurprisingly, the airport was pretty small. The flight was a couple of hours
  and uneventful, and as it was internal there wasn't much faff at either end.
  We got the bus in to KL and walked a bit over a mile to our hostel.

  After a quick lunch of Thai food, we went back to the hostel and had a look
  at what we could do that afternoon, quickly discovering that the wifi was
  pretty much inaccessible from our room. Damn, we'd been counting on it being
  decent so we could do onward planning.

  We walked across town to a street well known for its restaurants and street
  food for dinner. Rosie had a great chicken satay and I had bits of chicken
  and veg served in a wide ring of deep fried yam.

  After eating, we continued down the street, finding ourselves being directed
  to the sides of a street while a dragon dance was set up (presumably as part
  of Chinese new year celebrations? - it was 15 days ago...). There was a small
  stage on a corner of the street and somewhat out of the blue the announcer
  there welcomed "Michael Jackson" to the stage. This turned out to be a thin
  asian guy in a bright red suit dancing along to Despacito, occassionally
  singing a couple of the words. The dragon dance prep seemed forgotten and
  people were allowed back onto the street. It became more bizarre when
  fireworks suddenly went off on the next street over, right beside a large
  high-rise building, within a few metres of its windows.

  We left soon after "Michael" stopped his performance and the dragon dance
  started as the press of people meant we couldn't really see. We headed to
  KLCC park beside the Petronas Towers where there was a water and light show
  set to music. It was essentially a large number of fountains within a small
  lake near the Petronas Towers. Each fountain had a light under it shining up
  through the stream of water and would change colour through the full spectrum.
  There were hundreds of them, forming elaborate patterns and colour sequences.
  This apparently lasts two or three hours, with music accompanying it for about
  five minutes every half hour. It was an impressive show, but after about 45
  minutes we headed back to sleep.

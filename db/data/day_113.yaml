  Unsurprisingly, we didn't sleep well on the bus. It arrived at 5.30am (why is
  that an acceptable time to arrive? That's when we arrived in Luang Prabang,
  too). We got a taxi to our hostel and got our first taste of how cheap Bolivia
  is - £1 for an early morning 15 minute taxi journey.

  Our hostel owner was great, letting us in that early in the morning and even
  though our room wasn't ready, she let us sleep in an empty dormitory and let
  us have breakfast when we woke.

  Slightly more awake, we moved into our actual room, booked flights for our
  next journey in a few days time (giving ourselves a few nights' good sleep),
  then planned our couple of days in Sucre.

  We walked a few blocks to the centre of town and sampled some of what Sucre
  is known for - cheap, good quality chocolate. My kind of place. We ate them
  in the main square and had a bitof an unpleasant experience - a young boy came
  over offering to shine our (very dusty) shoes, which we refused, then an old
  man came begging. He was uncomfortably close and quickly became violent
  towards the boy, who narrowly avoided being hit. We stood up and I walked
  away and, slowly, so did the man.

  We were slightly unsettled, but then spotted Wilson and Sita. We learnt they
  were staying nearby, then made vague plans to meet up later in the next day or
  two. We left them and had an arepa and a cachapa for lunch - Venezualan
  pancakes with assorted fillings.

  Sucre is the original capital of Bolivia and retains the centre of the
  judicial system (so there are "Abogado" signs everywhere). The centre of
  government moved to La Paz after a civil war, but Sucre has quite a lot of
  historical significance. It's a white city with orange tiled rooves, a grid
  of streets and tiny pavements (clearly not designed for cars). It was
  originally a colonial city, built near enough to the mountain silver mines in
  Potosi.

  One of the important historical sites is the place where the Bolivian
  Declaration of Independence was signed. We had a tour of the building,
  originally built by the Jesuits (who were very important in early Bolivian
  colonial history). We learnt that Bolivia was originally much larger, with
  land lost in repeated wars with its neighbours. The most keenly felt loss is
  clearly their Pacific shore - they'd obviously like to regain access to the
  ocean.

  We watched the sunset from the Mirador cafe up the main hill in the Recoleta
  district with a few drinks. It was a good view, but not the best sunset we've
  seen. On the way down, we found an empty French-inspired restaurant with good
  food and a very flamboyant waiter.

  We landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida at about 5.30am with the thrilling
  prospect of a twelve hour layover. We found the bagel stall for breakfast
  (with a huge queue), then settled down in some seats. Rosie had downloaded
  quite a few episodes of Castle to tide us over. Throughout the day we moved
  several times to find working plugs and to stock up on food, but spent most
  of the time watching TV. Fairly uneventful, but it did pass the time.

  The flight to San Diego was fine and we were picked up by Rosie's parents.
  While both of us will soon be traveling on, we consider this the end of our
  trip. At this point, Rosie's here for another two weeks before heading to
  Boston (and Edinburgh for graduation, among other places), while I'm only
  here for a week before spending a few days in Northern Ireland then returning
  to work in Edinburgh on Monday 25th of June.

  It's been a fantastic trip, but I think we're both ready for a change. It's
  good to be back in a familiar place. That being said, we both still have
  repeated travel in the immediate future and neither of us have a flat yet, so
  we'll be living out of rucksacks/suitcases for a while yet.

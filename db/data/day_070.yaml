  We had a surfing lesson first thing this morning, so were up at 7am. We've
  both surfed before and had lessons, but having a lesson here was the easiest
  way to get transport to a good spot along with rental. Also, neither of us
  would claim to be any good at it, so a bit more instruction couldn't hurt.

  We were picked up by three guys in a people carrier at 7.30am and spent about
  half an hour driving to a beach. Along the way the roads were much more
  similar to Cambodia and Vietnam than they were to Malaysia, never mind
  Singapore. Small corrugated iron buildings dotted the side of the road with
  stray dogs roaming freely. There were far more scooters than cars, and after
  ten minutes we came upon someone who'd been thrown from their scooter after
  hitting a dog. The seemed to be fine, but shaken. The same couldn't be said
  for either the dog or the scooter.

  We pulled up to the beach and got out while the guys unfastened the surfboards
  from the roof of the car. We could see the waves in the distance but the place
  seemed empty - great. The waves were a reef break, meaning that they were
  breaking far enough off shore that we were brought out by a small boat.
  Despite going out hundreds of metres, it didn't get much deeper. The water was
  so clear that we could see the bottom and even some fish.

  When we got out to the break there was no one else there. We each had an
  instructor and there was one extra guy. We took our foam boards off the boat
  and paddled out. The waves were only breaking in one particular area, meaning
  it was easy enough to avoid the break and paddle around them to the left and
  right. We positioned ourselves as our instructors told us and both managed to
  stand up on our first wave, admittedly with a push from the guys behind us. <R>
  Whoooo!!!! </R>

  We were in the water for about two hours. More people arrived over that time,
  so when we left there were 10-15 of us in the water. The waves were perfect
  for our level. We caught most of the ones we attempted (often with a helping
  push), and were able to ride some of them for quite a long time. A lot of
  what I'd learnt years ago came back, so I managed to turn left and surf along
  the wave (then turn right to avoid crashing into a stand up paddle boarder
  coming the other way).

  The one problem with catching a wave for a long time is that we needed to
  paddle **a lot** to get back to the break. So, by the end of the two hours we
  were both pretty tired, but managed to get back into the boat to get back to
  shore. Overall, it was a great morning - I'd been looking forward to surfing
  again for a long time and this lived up to my expectations. <R> Guys, Daniel is
  underselling how tiring it was to paddle back out. I was exhasuted by the end. </R>

  Bak in Kuta, we had a decent, if small, lunch. I wasn't feeling that great
  (or at least my digestive system wasn't), so didn't want much. Unfortunately
  this kind of ruled our afternoon as once we got back to our guest house I
  needed to be within easy access of a toilet for most of the afternoon. We made
  the most of our confinement, however, and played plenty of games - charades,
  20 questions, etc.

  By dinner time I was feeling a bit better so we headed into town for dinner.
  We ended up at a place that specialised in galletes, which were fantastic. We
  finished with a nutella crepe, which was as good as expected. Back in our room
  it turned out I wasn't quite as recovered as I'd hoped. <R> Spoiler alert,
  he lived. </R>

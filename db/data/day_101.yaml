  Today started with a **huge** breakfast. We were asked what kind of eggs we
  would like, then served a fruit salad, granola in yoghurt and tiny crepes with
  dulce de leche. My omelette was served with bread and I'd opted for a hot
  chocolate. Needless to say, the banana I'd had before breakfast turned out to
  be a mistake.

  The main event of the day was a tour of the only winery within the city bounds
  of Santiago, sandwiched between the city and the Andes. We got there by taxi
  and metro (with a load of football fans in the metro), then picked up bikes
  and joined a tour.

  Unlike our winery tours in Mendoza, here we were guided through the vineyards
  and allowed to taste the grapes. We had Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot and Cabernet
  Sauvignon. They were all pretty sweet and juicy, smaller and rounder than
  grapes for eating. Many had shrivelled on the vines, leaving slightly juicy
  raisins. I kept some to try alongside the wines made from them, but it was
  hard to try and taste the specific flavours the grape varieties directly gave
  to the wines.

  We got an Uber back to where we'd ended our walking tour yesterday and ate at
  a traditional Chilean restaurant. I had something simmilar to a cottage pie,
  but much sweeter as the topping was corn rather than potatao and has sugar
  scattered over it. Probably not something I'll have again.

  Afterwards, we headed up the hill nearby to get a view over the entire city.
  It had a church at the top with a wedding going on and a large statue of Mary.
  The view was fantastic and the free water fountains were definitely
  appreciated.

  Dinner was more of an event than a meal. We went to a very upmarket restaurant
  called Borago and had a sixteen course tasting menu with seven paired wines.
  The food was primarily made from Chilean ingredients and, unsurprisingly given
  the number of courses, the portions were small. None of it was like food you
  would replicate at home - we had the Chilean national flower with a single
  translucent dot of flavour placed on each petal, drank a seafood soup from a
  bull's horn and cracked a sugary sheel of a cold creme brulee like desert made
  to look like part of the stone it was served on, and each of those were only
  parts of courses. It was a pretty surreal take on food, a bit like an extreme
  version of the few tasting menus I've had in Edinburgh.

  The day after Nyepi seems to be business as usual. Our plan for the day was to
  head to another Indonesian island - Flores. Denise was also leaving later in
  the day for a two week trip to Africa.

  Our flight was in the early afternoon, so I spent the morning catching up on
  the diary (but clearly not well enough, given that I'm writing this three days
  later). Denise arranged a taxi for us to Denpasar airport. The journey took
  a surprising amount of time because of all the traffic, but sped up once we
  reached a large toll road built over the water. There are quite a few bridges
  over other roads, making it feel like spaghetti junction, just above the sea.

  The airport wasn't busy, so we breezed through check in and security. For the
  second time this trip I found a key that I should have returned in my pocket
  at security ...

  The food in the domestic lounge was pretty decent. I had a reasonable fried
  duck and rice while Rosie had gado gado - an Indonesian dish of vegetables,
  peanut sauce, and, at least in this instance, rice crackers. Also, to my
  delight, there was a Beard Papa stall, so we were able to have some more of
  their delicious cream puffs. <R> Gado gado, or at least good gado gado, is
  amazing. I mean I know I have bit of a thing for peanut sauce but its just so
  good. </R>

  Our gate was changed and neither of us fully heard the announcement, but
  luckily decided to check it out. There was no longer a line at the gate, but
  still time before the flight left. Cream puffs in hand, we made it onto the
  plane.

  In less than an hour, we touched down in Labuan Bajo, Flores. We were picked
  up by a taxi from our hotel, which actually isn't that far away. The hotel
  is pretty nice with a decent large room and a helpful owner who gave us lots
  of advice. <R> He also paid for the taxi, as he had said he would come and pick
  us up but his father had taken the car. This was very nice of him and was a real
  indication of how lovely he was throughout our stay. </R>

  Labuan Bajo is pretty small and seems to exist as a gateway to Komodo National
  Park. We walked down into the centre from our hotel to arrange our next couple
  of days, checking out four or five of the tour agencies. They mostly run the
  same tours, but we were able to find close to what we wanted. We also had to
  pay for them and our four nights in the hotel today, so had a lot of cash on
  us. It looks like even more in Indonesian rupiah, given that $1 is just under
  Rp 14,000 and Â£1 is just under Rp 20,000. They don't seem to make notes less
  than Rp 2,000.

  We came back to the hotel to phone home as we have internet today and it's
  the weekend, making it easier to deal with the time difference. We went back
  to town to find dinner, an OK Italian meal, before heading to bed in
  preparation for an **early** start.

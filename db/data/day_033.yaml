  Definitely the weirdest moment of our trip so far - walking into a shop, asking
  to rent their bright pink tandem bicycle for 4.30am the next day and, oh, by the
  way, could they tumble-dry our puppet squirrel?

  Explaining the bike is easy enough: tomorrow we're going to cycle around Angkor,
  a large national park full of partially ruined temples. The squirrel, however
  requires a bit more explanation.

  About an hour after I wrote yesterday's entry, Rosie noticed a bed bug in our
  bed. We'd both heard horror stories from other travellers of incredibly itchy
  bed bug bites and how difficult they are to get rid of, so had looked them up to
  make sure we could identify them. I squashed it and, sure enough, quite a bit of
  blood seeped out. Worse, we had a look and within a minute or two had found
  another bug, which we caught as evidence. <R> Gross! </R>

  It was after 10pm, we hadn't had the best sleep for the past few nights and
  really wanted one good night's sleep before getting up early to see Angkor.
  Needless to say, this really wasn't what we wanted to deal with. What could we
  do? Try and change room? Change hotel at 10.30pm?

  The hotel had one other room free, so we packed up our stuff and moved downstairs. We
  piled our stuff on the floor away from walls or furniture and searched the beds
  for signs of bed bugs. There were some marks and black specks that could have
  been signs of them, but we weren't sure. We decided to just go to sleep and hope
  for the best, not that we had much choice. We also weren't completely sure that
  the bugs were from this hotel - we both had found small bites on ourselves at
  the previous hotel, but dismissed them because they weren't itchy. Not everyone
  reacts to bed bugs, so maybe we were both lucky enough not to and accidentally
  brought them from the old hotel.

  After a not-so-restful night's sleep, we woke up without being bitten. We took
  advantage of having moved room to one with a warm shower (luxury!), then checked
  with reception. The room we'd moved to was booked for the next few days, but
  they gave us our money back for the other two nights we had planned to stay. We
  booked ourselves into a new hotel across town, left our bags behind the hotel
  desk and went out to explore Siem Reap.

  After breakfast and failing to find a bank, we spent part of the day in the
  national museum learning more about the Khmer Empire, Hinduism and Buddhism. <R>
  I will readily admit that my knowledge of all three is lacking however the museum,
  while very informative only really added to my confusion. It doesn't help that there
  is a significant melding of Buddhism and Hinduism within the Khmer Empire but while
  I learned a lot from the museum I'm still just so confused about both religions. </R> We
  returned to our first hotel, picked up our rucksacks and walked a mile or so to
  our new hotel. The guy there was very friendly, but said that unfortunately the
  free bikes that came with the hotel couldn't be used at night, so if we wanted
  to get to Angkor Wat for sunrise we'd have to hire some elsewhere.

  We had to head out anyway - we still had to get our laundry from our first
  hotel. It was pretty lucky we'd decided to do laundry as soon as we arrived the
  day before as bed bugs apparently often stow away in your clothing, so having
  most of our clothes out of the afflicted room was great. However, a few of our
  things did remain in the room until we left - most notably Rosie's
  [world-traveling squirrel puppet](https://www.instagram.com/travelingtufty/).
  We couldn't really both wash him and take him to Angkor Wat, so needed to find
  a tumble drier - one of the sure-fire ways of killing stowaway bed bugs. <R>
  Unfortunately most laundrettes in Siem Reap air dry the clothes they wash, which
  is good but didn't really help us in this (admittedly niche) situation. Fortunately
  as we were trying to hire our tandem for the next day I saw that the place we
  were hiring it from also had a laundry service with a tumble drier. After some confusion
  the squirrel was officially bed bug free and much much warmer. </R>

  With our tandem hired and the squirrel cleansed, we set off on the bike to pick up
  the laundry. Until now, I've found the crazy roads here to be strangely relaxing
  - you just walk at a steady pace across a busy road and assume everyone will
  stop or go around you. Of course you look to make sure you're safe, but otherwise
  pretty much relax. It's not like that on a tandem, particularly when you haven't
  ridden one in a few years. Starting a tandem is often a multi-step shaky process
  which doesn't lend itself well to stop-start traffic with lanes that are taken
  as guidelines at best rather than hard and fast rules. Add to that the fact that
  it was night and it was pretty clear pretty quickly that we were going to have
  a totally new experience of Cambodian roads. <R> This knowledge combined with the
  fact that we had just agreed to wake up at 4:30am to cycle all day in the Cambodian
  heat and I was pretty sure we were looking at the end of our relationship. </R>

  After two miles of hair-raising cycling, we'd picked up our laundry and dropped
  of our bike at our hotel. We headed out in search of dinner and ended up at a
  Khmer barbecue and soup place definitely aimed at locals. It was slightly
  bizarre, with blaring music and a Cambodian-dubbed Chinese film playing in the
  background. We were given a portable gas stove with a large dish on top filled
  with soup. The centre of the dish was a hemisphere rising out of the soup with
  small slits to let the heat out like a grill. We were given veg to put in the
  soup, fat and butter to put on the grill and meat covered in egg and sesame
  seeds to cook. It's also the first place we've been where we were given
  chopsticks and not a fork. It got better as the soup got stronger and one of
  the dipping sauces that we couldn't identify (looked like tahini, but wasn't)
  was great. <R> Nothing at this restaurant was in english at all so despite the fact
  that it was all very tasty we're still not sure what we ate. Also the servers
  couldn't give us any instructions so although I believe the premise of the meal is DIY
  they ended up a doing a lot of it for us, they were lovely and very patient. </R>

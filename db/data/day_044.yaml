  After our late night (1am!), we had a late morning lie in (10am). Today was
  pretty relaxed, partly due to not that much being on. We tried to find a decent
  breakfast place, but the recommended ones were shut. I ended up getting a rice
  porridge with pork, which I was intrigued to try but wasn't surprised when it
  wasn't anything special.

  After a similar experience at lunch, we went to the War Remnants Museum, one of
  the few places still open. They have a large number of American military
  vehicles on display outside which were used in the war. Inside, it's a
  three-story building dedicated to Vietnamese independence and unification,
  focusing mainly on the horrific things done to the Vietnamese by the USA (and
  somewhat by the French). It's definitely a one-sided take on events, but the
  photography exhibition coupled with descriptions of how the photographers died
  and the pictures of the genetic defects caused by Agent Orange were terrible
  and sobering. In particular, it'll be hard to forget the picture of the woman
  born without eyeballs.

  Having got one side of the story, we spent some time during and after dinner
  looking up more about the war to try and get more of a full picture.

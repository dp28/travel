  We got up early to catch a bus to the fishmarket to have a look at what was on
  offer. There wasn't a huge haul on show, but we stil saw plenty of different
  fish. By the sea, there were flocks of gulls, several pelicans and half a
  dozen giant sea lions swimming in the shallow water below the pier.

  We had breakfast back at the hotel, then checked out and drove to another of
  Pablo Neruda's houses. It was a strange, five storey building filled with
  trinkets Pablo Neruda had collected and a horde of tourists following their
  audio guides from floor to floor. We parked nearby and immediately a man on
  the street demanded 2000 pesos ($3/£2.50) to "take care of" the car. A stall
  owner beside us quietly told us not to do so and eventually the other man left
  us alone.

  We drove back to Santiago, dropping the car off at the airport as we caught a
  plane north to Calama. We collected another rental car, a 4x4, then drove for
  another hour through the Atacama desert towards San Pedro de Atacama.

  Just before arriving, we stopped at the entrance to a National Park called the
  Valley of the Moon, a strange, lunar landscape of reddish rock spread out
  below a cliff that we could view it from. The sun slowly set at the end of the
  cliff face, casting a brilliant light across the valley and lengthening the
  shadows of the sharp rocks jutting out from the valley floor.

  We arrived at a small town of orangy-brown adobe buildings, checking into a
  hotel with a pool in a central courtyard. We walked into town and had a
  delicious dinner in another courtyard with a fire near our table.

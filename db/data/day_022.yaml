  This was supposed to be the day with the best weather, but was much the same as the previous few
  days - some cloud, some sun. We walked south to the beach we'd arrived at and rented a sit on top
  kayak and snorkel gear. There were a pair of small islands a couple of kilometres from the hotel we
  rented the kayak from which were supposed to be good for snorkeling.

  We headed out towards the islands with small waves slightly against us and to the side - just enough
  to cause us to have to fight a bit to maintain our course, but not too strong. The water remained
  pretty clear and shallow enough to see the bottom for quite a long way, but the waves meant the
  surface wasn't still enough to see much.

  We knew that one of the islands was privately owned and had a fee of 100 baht ($3/Â£2.50) for landing
  on it, but we didn't know which one. We landed briefly on the first island, on a tiny beach with
  forest right up against it. The broken bits of coral there were incredibly intricate, but it didn't
  look like the best place to snorkel. We kayaked out around the second island, avoiding a beach with
  a crane and people building something, landing on a beach at the back. At no point on either island
  did anyone appear to demand 100 baht - I'm not sure if there even were people on the first island.

  The beach on the second island was stunning - a small band of white sand squeezed between the forest
  to one side and cliffs on the other, with forest covering the steep hill behind the beach. Not far
  from the beach was a tiny cove cut into the cliff with just enough of a sand bar for a single tree.

  We went snorkeling between the beach and the cove and saw loads of life. In addition to the spiky
  black sea urchins, there were plenty of small fish of a variety of colours and some larger, more
  impressive ones - a delicate golden fish that we both initially mistook for a big leaf and a
  leopard-spotted fish (which I think was the same type as was caught by our host a few days before,
  robbing Rosie of the chance for a mojito). The most impressive sights, though were the openings into
  the giant clams. These were bright blues or deep reds, often sunken into the sand or something that
  looked like a rock so that all I could see was a wavy coloured line, opening and closing.

  After snorkeling for a while, we got back on the kayak and headed back to shore.  <R> The wind had
  really picked up by this time and we were kayaking at a funny angle to it so every other stroke we
  had to try and correct our course, it was exhausting but good fun. </R> We were able to
  use the hotel's outdoor shower and were sorely tempted by its pool, which we probably weren't
  allowed. We finished off the day at a bakery and art hut, which had some pretty decent food and
  several cats. After we ordered, someone was immediately dispatched to buy the ingredients (bananas)
  that they'd run out of. I tried another avocado & banana shake, unfortunately not as smooth as in
  Luang Prabang.

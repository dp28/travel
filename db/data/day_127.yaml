  Almost all of our waking time today was spent on a bus to Cusco: 9.30am to
  10pm. The bus was 90 minutes late, partly due to some sort of local holiday
  and celebration that added to traffic. We did get to hear some music and see
  some dancing.

  The low point of the day was somewhere in the middle when we arrived at an
  intermediary bus station. Two other tourists (gringos) got off the bus, having
  apparently been told we had half an hour there. I got off and asked an
  official-looking guy nearby who said we had five minutes. I quickly went to
  the toilet and replenished our snack supplies, but when I returned to the
  stand the bus was gone ...

  <R>
  Meanwhile on the bus which was trying to leave without Daniel I and
  another women who's boyfriend had also got off to go to the toilet had a shouting
  match with the conductor trying to force him to wait for them. He kept shouting
  back that he had a schedual to keep and that we were already late. In the end
  he said that he would drive round to the frount of the bus station and wait for
  them there. I made the point that Daniel didn't know the bus would be out frount
  but everyone on the bus told me it would be ok and a large number of women
  tried to confort me saying that they would make the bus driver wait. I was still
  pretty panicked.

  People nearby told me to go to the other side of the station, so I ran. The
  bus wasn't there, but multiple people told me to wait. The bus pulled around
  the corner in a few minutes and reluctantly stopped for me. The conductor
  clearly wasn't happy, but let me on.

  There was no sign of the other people who'd got off and the passengers seemed
  to be divided between being strongly in favour of leaving and strongly in
  favour of waiting, but very vocal either way. Twenty minutes down the road the
  bus stopped after the driver had received a call, telling him to wait until
  the two managed to get a taxi to the bus. Needless to say, many of the
  passengers weren't amused.

  <R>
  Hands down worst bus conductor ever!

  A long time later we got to Cusco. We got a taxi to our hotel, were let in by
  presumably the owner, then went to sleep.

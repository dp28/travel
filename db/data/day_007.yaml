  Today we went on a tour organised through our hotel. It was an all-in-one kind
  of deal - see a couple of waterfalls, the highest point in Thailand, a couple of
  chedis, lunch, visit a couple of local tribes. Basically, we got on
  a minibus, drove around quite a bit, got off for half an hour here and there to
  take pictures, then back on the bus. Thrilling.

  We both realised this sort of activity isn't really for us. We'd rather see only
  the sites we find interesting (mainly the scenery) and be able to stop at things
  we only glimpsed out the window, like the flower farms. <R> So apparently at the
  national park that we went to there is an amazing walk that shows off the regions
  native rhododendron flower and I really wanted to go to it but we weren't allowed
  to for some reason, which was really sad. </R>The obligatory market stops were no
  where near as informative a view on local life as the museum
  yesterday was. The repeated grumblings from the three people in the back seat
  who'd been told incorrectly that they could go swimming didn't really brighten
  the bus journey back. <R> However there were some very very cute puppies so that
  made up for it. </R>

  Some of the sights were impressive, though, particularly the view from the
  chedis (or pagodas). It was interesting to learn that they had been constructed
  by the Thai Air Force, but we were unable to learn why particularly they built
  them, other than in honour of the king and queen's birthdays.

  Today I gave in and had a slice of the lemon meringue pie. Like the ones in
  Argentina, it had an emphasis on soft meringue, and not particularly tart
  lemon.

  We rented some bikes (three almost brand new bikes and one with some clear
  wear) and cycled out to the Valle de la Luna which we had seen at sunset a few
  days ago. There was paved road until the valley, then the path deteriorated
  into gravel and sand. We cycled through the valley, stopping every so often at
  different places pointed out on a map we'd got at the entrance. We climbed
  through salt caves, up rocky hills and sand dunes and earned some fantastic
  views over the bleak landscape.

  We cycled to the end of the valley to see a strange rock formation that we all
  agreed probably weren't worth the slog back up the bumpy hill in the heat. It
  was a bit quicker getting back to the start as it was mainly down hill and
  there was the promise of cool water or Fanta at the end. After a stop for the
  drinks, we got back on the tarmac road and dropped off the bikes where we'd
  got them.

  We spent the afternoon planning the start of our time in Bolivia after having
  a bit of ice cream in the main square. We had another good dinner with savoury
  profiteroles and a traditional tres leches dessert.

  After dinner we had a stargazing tour booked. We were picked up and driven out
  from the town a bit to reduce the effect of the slight light pollution. Our
  very enthusiastic guide set up telescopes to let us look at the moon, then
  gave us a talk about the history of astronomy and some of the principles of
  some of the telescopes we were using. We learnt about the constellations and
  how to use the Southern Cross to find which direction is south. It turns out
  our guide had previously worked on the telescopes at ALMA, the massive
  international telescope located nearby, high in the Atacama desert.

  There were a few tables of snacks and drinks provided, along with heaters and
  blankets. Through the telescopes we saw galaxies, nebula, binary stars, Mars,
  Jupiter and Saturn. Rosie was able to borrow a camera lense to take a few
  fantastic shots of the Milky Way.

  However, we had originally had planned to get up around 6am tomorrow to go and
  see geysers at dawn, but the class was taking quite a long time. We finally
  ended at 2am and scrapped the idea of an early morning.

  After a few expensive days, we planned to spend less today. When we had
  arrived, our host at the hotel had offered to take us to a couple of local
  sites free of charge, so we asked to do that today.

  The first stop was at a large limestone cave which, if you're lucky (we
  weren't) you can see the refracted light from the sun. We had a guide and a
  trainee show us around, pointing out massive stalagmites and stalagtites. They
  took us into a natural room further within the cave complex where the roof was
  ancient coral complete with a fossilized turtle.

  On our way to the other attraction of the day in the battered old SUV we got
  chatting to our host, originally from Lombok. He'd come to Flores in 2005 and
  worked as a tour salesman, but by the sounds of things had become addicted to
  online gambling. He then conned tourists out of money to fund it, then went on
  the run across Indonesia. He ended up in prison for a couple of years and said
  after living on the street it was significantly preferrable. He'd now seen the
  error of his ways and gave free tours to tourists (like the one we were on) as
  a way of repenting. The hotel we were staying in belongs to his father, who'd
  given him a job after he was released, but had refused to help him when he was
  down, saying he had to clean up his own mess. He now values that harsh
  fairness from his father.

  He also pointed out a huge new hotel being built, with about 500 rooms each at
  twice the next most expensive places to stay in Labuan Bajo (which happen to
  be fancy boat hotels that only have about six rooms). He thinks that there
  just isn't the demand, so may just be a way of cleaning money. That being
  said, apparently it's fully booked for September, so there's a lot of pressure
  on the workers to finish on time.

  Our other stop was an impressive viewpoint from the top of a steep hill down
  onto curved sandy bays with sunlit green and blue sea. There were only a few
  other people around (and the obligatory drone).

  Back in Labuan Bajo, we went to the restaurant of the people we'd booked our
  snorkeling with the day before. We had some pretty good food, including the
  first burger we'd ordered so far on the trip (apart from the free burger at
  Marry Brown fast food chain in KL, which may not have been enough of a burger
  to count ...). We wrote a load of postcards, then posted them, only to find
  out that here you get a free postcard with every stamp, so now we have a load
  more.

  We shopped for some souvenirs with some success, wrote a few more diary
  entries, and had some more decent sushi for dinner. I finally actually added
  the new entries to the site for the first time in a week before packing for
  our early flight, then went to sleep.

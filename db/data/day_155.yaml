  This was our last day in South America. We packed up for the last time then
  left our luggage in the hotel. We had breakfast in a bakery (melted chocolate
  **and** hot chocolate for breakfast - that's a good day), then caught a bus to
  the middle of the world.

  Ok, it ended up being two buses and by "middle of the world" I mean "Mitad del
  Mundo" - a point on the equator close to Quito that's a bit of a tourist
  attraction. It turns out there are two lines there marked as the equator - one
  calculated by an international group quite a long time ago and another a few
  hundred metres away calculated by GPS. There's a massive monument on the first
  line and a kind of outdoor museum at the second. Needless to say, we took
  plenty of photos at each.

  We also went to a chocolate museum there, had a hot chocolate, had a local
  beer and had lunch. We'd been wanting to try llapingachos and managed to find
  them - a kind of fried potato cake. Before going to the museum, we tried to
  find the equator with the GPS on Rosie's phone and found out that it doesn't
  have a 0'0"0 - only 0'0"1N and 0'0"0S.

  The GPS equatorial line museum was particularly fun. We had a guide who showed
  us several phenomena specific to the equator, although I'm not sure how many
  of them were completely true. The famous one is that water going down a plug
  spins anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern.
  Our guide said that's only true quite far away but was able to demonstrate it
  using some trick. She also demonstrated that it was easier for her to push our
  arms down despite our resistance on the equator than beside it, but I'm not
  sure how that works. We also tried to walk along the line with our eyes
  closed, which is surprisingly difficult - it's noticeably harder to stay
  balanced. Finally, we each balanced an egg on the head of a nail as the
  equator is apparently the easiest place in the world to do so. Rosie was,
  sadly, much faster than me, but her job has included the need to be steady
  handed ...

  After another super-cheap hour long bus journey ($0.40 each) we were back in
  the centre of Quito. We ended up going to a restaurant in the theatre -
  expensive, but it was our last night. We had better llapingachos, plenty of
  avocado and deep fried banana - a great way to round off Ecuador. Even better,
  dessert came with a shot of melted chocolate (twice in one day!). The
  restaurant was pretty nice, particularly the free taxi to our hotel. I also
  enjoyed the pan pipe covers of pop songs.

  We got a taxi to the airport, then checked in (with the kind of expected faff
  around me having an ESTA). The flight was a little late, meaning we didn't
  actually leave at one minute to midnight, but our time in South America
  spilled into the next day.

  We were picked up a little after 7am by a minibus headed for the Bolivian
  border. It should have taken about 40 minutes, but an accident on the road
  ahead of us meant that we spent an hour at a standstill.

  The border was high, open and chilly. The Bolivian side was noticeably run
  down compared to the Chilean side, but it was all pretty efficient. We had a
  surprisingly good breakfast of bread, cheese, ham and avocado with biscuits
  and hot drinks. There were several minibuses of us and we were separated into
  groups of six, one group per 4x4. We clambered into the back of one with a
  couple from London called Wilson and Sita, an Australian called Caitlin and
  an American called Didi who'd been studying in Sydney with Caitlin, and our
  driver, Leo. We'd probably been grouped by our native language, but it turned
  out to be a good group. <R> We were particuarly glad to not have been paired
  with one of the two groups of Brazilians, who seemed nice enough but litterally
  never stopped talking. </R>

  Our first two stops were at high altitude lagoons, one significantly whiter
  and another much greener, due to the mineral contents. We overtook a group
  of cyclists later and met them when we stopped at some hot springs - they were
  cycling most of the length of South America and spending eight days crossing
  the Atacama. We had lunch at the springs (also really good), then headed on.

  There was a lot of driving, so we got through a good chunk of our audiobook.
  We stopped for a short time at a Dali-esque desert, followed by a set of
  geysers. The wind was strong, causing the fumaroles to look like fog over the
  ground while the odd bit of snow gusted about us.

  We had a longer walk at the "laguna colorada", a very red lake filled with
  flamingoes with green algae and white salt. On our way to the village we were
  to stay in, we stopped to help another 4x4 which had broken down (not the last
  time over our three-day trip). At the village, Leo  <R> our driver </R> was very happy to get us
  all double rooms despite the tour operator stating that we would be sharing a
  dorm. He made us all a delicious dinner before we went to sleep.

  I wasn't particularly looking forward to this morning. There's something about a six-hour bus
  journey in the immediate future that just hints that it's not going to be a great day. However, the
  bus was actually pretty decent - a reclining seat (including leg rest), free snack & water, and an
  on-board toilet. We also spent the journey listening to a fairly intense part of the Wheel of Time
  series, which made the time fly. <R> Note: You can convince Daniel to do just about anything if
  you allow him to listen to the Wheel of Time at the same time. </R>

  Up next was the Laos border crossing, 4km from the bus stop. That required a tuk tuk ride, a $35
  dollar fee & passport photo for a visa, an extra $1 because it's the weekend and a songthaew 10km
  to the town we're staying in (Huay Xai).

  Negotiating the songthaew took quite a long time because we had to do it with the four other
  tourists who had just crossed the border. We all had different amounts of different currencies and
  different ideas of what was a good deal. The driver spoke very little English and kept changing
  between giving prices in Thai baht and Lao kip. After everyone was somewhat happy, we were on our
  way - on the *right* side of the road. In Thailand, they drive on the left.

  We found our hotel, dumped our stuff, got money, booked our bus away in three days and checked in
  with our reason for being here - the Gibbon Experience, which we start tomorrow. Finished
  organising, we found a riverside restaurant to eat, read, and enjoy the sunset over the Mekong
  river, <R> which was gorgeous </R>.

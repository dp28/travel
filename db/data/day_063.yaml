  Still somewhat tired from the walk yesterday, we had a bit of a lie in. We
  used the rest of the morning by going for a few small walks along the board
  walks by the resort. At the start of the first one we heard a slithering in
  the dried leaves and saw a thin black snake make its way away from the path.

  In the afternoon we went on a "rapid shooting" tour, which basically meant
  getting in one of the long, thin boats we'd arrived in and going straight
  through the rapids up river, getting thoroughly soaked in the process. At the
  first set of rapids, however, the propellor hit a rock and the engine stopped.
  The boat floated downstream and the driver and the guy at the front of the
  boat both jumped out and swam the boat closer to shore. The guy at the front
  held it where he could stand while the other guy fixed the problem. It started
  to rain, but after five minutes or so we were off and successfully navigated
  the rapids.

  By this point, the rain was at full force. Even if we hadn't had waves
  occasionally soaking us, we would have been drenched in minutes. As we'd
  expected to get wet, it was pretty enjoyable.

  The boat stopped beside a small village so that the other tourists with us
  could go and se the Orang Asli (aboriginal people). We'd opted not to as we
  hadn't enjoyed similar things in the past, we know the money doesn't really go
  to them and that, if not for tourist money, they're traditionally nomadic.
  Instead, we swam in the river which was noticeably warmer than the rain.
  Unfortunately, that seems to have killed my watch, despite claiming to be
  water resistant to 100m and dealing with worse submersion before. Damn.

  Back in Kuala Tahan, we showered, dried and I caught up on this diary (a bit).
  After dinner, we went for our own night walk. We weren't quite as good as our
  guide, but saw plenty of spiders, a rat, a mouse, a frog, and several
  porcupines, but sadly no fireflies.

  Back at the guest house we saw our final creature of the forest - a leech
  attached to my neck. I have no idea how it had gotten there. Apparently 15%
  DEET (the highest you can buy here) wasn't a strong enough **deet**erent.
  After removing (and flushing) the leech, wecould see it was just a small cut,
  but it bled a lot. Leeches apply an anticoagulant to stop blood clots, so I
  significantly bled through my first plaster. A makeshift absorbant pad of
  toilet paper micropore-taped to my neck worked much better.

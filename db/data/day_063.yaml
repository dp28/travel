:entry: "Still somewhat tired from the walk yesterday, we had a bit of a lie in. We\nused
  the rest of the morning by going for a few small walks along the board\nwalks by
  the resort. At the start of the first one we heard a slithering in\nthe dried leaves
  and saw a thin black snake make its way away from the path.\n\nIn the afternoon
  we went on a \\\"rapid shooting\\\" tour, which basically meant\ngetting in one
  of the long, thin boats we'd arrived in and going straight\nthrough the rapids up
  river, getting thoroughly soaked in the process. At the\nfirst set of rapids, however,
  the propellor hit a rock and the engine stopped.\nThe boat floated downstream and
  the driver and the guy at the front of the\nboat both jumped out and swam the boat
  closer to shore. The guy at the front\nheld it where he could stand while the other
  guy fixed the problem. It started\nto rain, but after five minutes or so we were
  off and successfully navigated\nthe rapids. <R> Daniel is down playing this. There
  was a really loud clunk and \nthen the motor stoped and we started floating backwards
  down river at really \nquite an impressive speed. The guide at the front then splashed
  out and kicked \nus into a backwater while the guy at the back started pounding
  on the motor, \npresumably fixing the propellor. </R>\n\nBy this point, the rain
  was at full force. Even if we hadn't had waves\noccasionally soaking us, we would
  have been drenched in minutes. As we'd\nexpected to get wet, it was pretty enjoyable.
  <R> It was great, I love it when \nit rains and you were already planning on getting
  wet. </R>\n\nThe boat stopped beside a small village so that the other tourists
  with us\ncould go and se the Orang Asli (aboriginal people). We'd opted not to as
  we\nhadn't enjoyed similar things in the past, we know the money doesn't really
  go\nto them and that, if not for tourist money, they're traditionally nomadic.\nInstead,
  we swam in the river which was noticeably warmer than the rain.\nUnfortunately,
  that seems to have killed my watch, despite claiming to be\nwater resistant to 100m
  and dealing with worse submersion before. Damn.\n\nBack in Kuala Tahan, we showered,
  dried and I caught up on this diary (a bit).\nAfter dinner, we went for our own
  night walk. We weren't quite as good as our\nguide, but saw plenty of spiders, a
  rat, a mouse, a frog, and several\nporcupines, but sadly no fireflies.\n\nBack at
  the guest house we saw our final creature of the forest - a leech\nattached to my
  neck. I have no idea how it had gotten there. Apparently 15%\nDEET (the highest
  you can buy here) wasn't a strong enough **deet**erent. <R> \nTo be fair to the
  leech, and the DEET, there is a chance that Daniel missed \nspaying that particuar
  bit of skin as it was very near the neck line. How it \ngot on to his neck though
  is anyones guess, they can't really climb. </R> \nAfter removing (and flushing)
  the leech, wecould see it was just a small cut,\nbut it bled a lot. Leeches apply
  an anticoagulant to stop blood clots, so I\nsignificantly bled through my first
  plaster. A makeshift absorbant pad of\ntoilet paper micropore-taped to my neck worked
  much better.\n"

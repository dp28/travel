  We had a mid-morning flight to Bali, so had breakfast then got a shuttle from
  our guest house to the airport. I was feeling a bit better than yesterday,
  which was lucky given that we were spending quite a bit of it traveling. I
  hadn't slept well, so both of us ended up asleep on the brief flight.

  We got a taxi to Ubud to stay with my mum's friend Denise for a few days.
  Unfortunately, she was currently in Jakarta at a meeting, but we were greeted
  by her housekeeper and given a fantastic lunch. <R> Thanks Denise and Jeru! </R>

  Denise's house was amazing, just outside of the centre of Ubud, big and open
  (and thankfully cool). We were staying in a smaller building just on the other
  side of the pool from the main house. We caught glimpses of her four cats
  (some more shy than others and one that seemed particularly afraid of me) and
  met her two dogs, Lily and Ski. <R> The dogs were very cute. </R>

  We spent the afternoon wandering down into Ubud, having a look at temples and
  buying a couple of things at the market. We followed a small walk through the
  rice paddies out of the town, surprisingly close to the centre. As we walked
  we came across a lone, limping chick, cheeping for its mother without success.
  We heard what we thought were chickens 100m up the path, so (after a brief
  chase) caught it and brought it to the enclosure. It turned out they were
  actually ducks ... so we went the other way down the path until hearing a
  cockerel, beside which was a chicken with similar-sized chicks. <R> Good dead
  done for the day. </R>

  We went back to the house for a little while o drop off stuff, then headed
  back into town for dinner. Ubud has a very wide selection of restaurants, so
  we went for a decent-looking tapas place and ended up with some fantastic
  food. I topped off the evening with a little bit of raw chocolate from a
  chocolate shop / factory up the road. <R> He said he was only going in to \"look\". </R>

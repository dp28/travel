  We didn't have any early morning commitments today, so we could have a bit of
  a lie in. After a tasty pineapple-heavy breakfast, we packed up (programmed a
  little), then changed hotel to somewhere nearer the sea and further from the
  loud adhan. The new place is nice, not quite as nice as the previous place,
  but does have a mosquito net and rents snorkeling gear.

  We rented snorkels, masks and fins and went snorkeling beside the harbour near
  by. We saw quite a few fish, but the reef wasn't as vibrant elsewhere. We did
  also see what was probably a smallish sea snake.

  We showered and walked up to the north of the island for some reasonable (and
  cheap) lunch, then picked up the snorkeling gear again and walked around the
  southern half of the island clockwise to go snorkeling again. Here there were
  quite a few boats out and several groups of other snorkelers, probably because
  of the underwater sculptures. There was a ring of life size human statues a
  few metres down just off the coast and quite a few people around it with
  GoPros taking picures, so of course we joined in. One group consisted mainly
  of people in lifejackets, which they would occasionally remove, with guides
  positioning them and taking videos of the statues for them. It was slightly
  bizarre to have the standard tourist throng with everyone trying to take the
  same picture - something we've experienced **a lot** over the last three
  months - only this time underwater.

  On the way back in we happened to encounter a turtle (I think it was a
  hawksbill turtle) really close beside us. It swam in one direction, then
  turned around towards us and swam back the way it had came to our right to go
  up and get air. Rosie managed to get some decent shots on the GoPro of it.

  We walked back to our hotel overland (we couldn't go past the salt lake
  because it had flooded the path) to shower so we could head to another place
  in the north of the island for dinner. The restaurant was called Little Bali
  and was filled with Balinese art. I had a Nasi Campur, which is rice with
  small amounts of local dishes, so I got interesting veg chooped finely (almost
  like a pico de gallo) covered in fish sauce, tofu, tempe (kind of like a
  soybean cake), grilled chicken and a brilliant beef rendang. I also had fried
  banana for pudding, which was excellent.

  We played three rounds of pool at the pool table in the restaurant after the
  meal, all won or lost due to my luck rather than skill. I won one game
  primarily due to potting balls in ways that I had not intended. I lost the
  other two by accidentally poting the black prematurely ...

  This was a bit of a roller coaster of a morning. We had to get up at **4am**, to
  get a flight, but it took ages to get to sleep. I woke up when the alarm went
  off and checked my phone - the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours.
  I've never been happier for a delay. The next three hours of sleep weren't
  great, but were very welcome.

  We caught a bus just after 8am, getting to the airport with plenty of time. At
  the bag drop desk we were given meal vouchers because of the flight delay and
  could get more in an hour for lunch. However, we soon discovered here was only
  one place they could be redeemed in our terminal which may have been the worst
  fast food place I've ever eaten. The curly fries were ok and the coke float
  (for breakfast?) was too, but the bright yellow paste smeared onto my burger
  was definitely not cheese, not even cheeseburger-worthy cheese. We decided to
  skip the free lunch.

  Despite being a cheap flight we had a free meal (not that I ate much) and an
  entertainment system (although I mainly programmed). The airport in Borneo,
  Tawau, was pretty tiny, and we very quickly managed to find a minibus driver
  with two spare seats to take us to Semporna, where we'll stay for two nights. <R>
  It was all surprisingly efficient. </R>

  We drove for an hour on decent roads through miles and miles of palm trees,
  presumably farmed for palm oil. We arrived in Semporna, which seems like the
  exact opposite of the natural paradise it could be. At the edge of clear ocean
  dotted with jungle-covered islands, it could be idyllic, but instead it is
  run-down, so filled with litter and the odd open sewer that it's not too far
  away from a tip.

  Unfortunately, our ~~hotel~~ accommodation isn't much better. When we arrived in
  Semporna, Rosie immediately went to book snorkeling for the next day before the
  place shut while I checked in, or at least tried to. I took off my shoes
  (standard when entering many buildings in South East Asia), then spent a good
  few minutes wandering through the corridor saying "Hello?" before someone
  eventually came out of a dorm to talk to me. Initially he told me to bring my
  stuff into the dorm, but we'd booked a private room. He took a while to check
  my confirmation email on my phone, then knocked on the door of another room
  where I think another couple had recently checked in. He then had several
  conversations with them and on his phone, then moved them into the (otherwise
  empty?) dorm and gave me the room. Weird.

  The room itself is another box and hasn't been cleaned in a **while**.
  Presumably for structural support, there are a few breeze blocks under the bed,
  just back enough from the edge that you can't see them but close enough to stub
  a toe on, as we can both attest to.

  We found a restaurant on a jetty (most of the town is on one jetty or another)
  where Rosie had some decent prawns. The place seems to be filled with Chinese
  tourists - some places accept WeChat Pay, which I thought was China-only
  (apparently it's not). We finished he nigh with a cupcake (we were surprised to
  find them) and Rosie had a Corona (with kumquat in it - no limes were
  available). <R> The fact that I put kumquat in my Corona seemed to both shock and
  amuse the bar staff, apparently they had never heard of the process. It's better
  with lime. </R>

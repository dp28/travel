  This was probably the best day so far. Straight after breakfast we were picked
  up and went to Asia Scenic cooking school. Maybe that breakfast was a bad idea.

  We teamed up with a mixed group of ten other people and each chose seven
  different recipes to make over the day. We donned strikingly pink aprons, toured
  a local garden and market to learn more about specific Thai ingredients, then
  headed back to the kitchen.

  It was fun, informative and the food was informative. Rosie and I made
  completely different recipes, so we got the opportunity to taste plenty of new
  things. Rosie learnt how to make a delicious northern Thai curry she'd had the
  day before, Khaw Soi, and I got quite a bit of two desserts, deep fried banana
  and blue sticky rice with mango. I really enjoy making curry, so it was great to
  get to make and try several curry pastes. Best of all, I'm pretty sure most of
  the ingredients will be available in Edinburgh (somewhere) - I want to learn
  things that I can make at home. <R> For some reason Daniel decided to make all of
  his dishes super spicy which meant that he got a more lot of my food than I got
  of his... suspicious. </R>

  Funnily enough we didn't need dinner. We had a wander through the night market
  so Rosie could buy some Thai trousers (Thaits? <R> NOPE! </R>) and - shock horror
  - it actually rained! At least, enough water fell from the sky for two minutes
  to prompt the stall keepers to put out shelters, then the rain promptly stopped.

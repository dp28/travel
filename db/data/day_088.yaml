  This was our last full day in Sydney, April Fool's day (not that we noticed),
  and Easter Sunday. Knowing that we have a lot of traveling tomorrow, and
  therefore probably crappy sleep, we had a decent lie in. Once we got up, I
  wrote a little bit of the diary (which I've been neglecting). We then had a
  bit of a booking bonanza for Argentina, spurred by the fact that we may need
  proof of onward travel to enter. Not sure if I'm looking forward to those bus
  journeys - the seven hour one during the day across the Andes should be
  spectacular, but the fifteen hour one through the night may not be.

  Sydney was still pretty quiet because of Easter, but we found a streetfood
  area called Spice Alley where we were able to get reasonable versions of
  South East Asian food for quite a bit more than we had been paying for over
  the last few months. Still worth it for the roti, though.

  We met up with Tara and Callum again to play ping pong at a public table in a
  park near their house (they have their own bats and balls). The wind made an
  interesting fifth player. We then walked down to Darling harbour to meet
  Marianne, then meandered past the conference centre and restaurants, over a
  bridge and sat and chatted by the water. We spent the early evening in an
  interesting 1920s style bar called Palmer & Co which was pretty busy by the
  time we left.

  Like the previous few days, it took a little while to find somewhere that was
  open for dinner. During our search, Marianne stopped at a supermarket to buy
  us a packet of Timtams, insisting that we couldn't leave Australia without
  doing a Timtam slam. Timtams are biscuits similar to Penguins - two chocolate
  biscuit slabs with chocolate cream inbetween, all coated in chocolate. A
  Timtam slam is where you bite off the opposite corners of the Timtam, then use
  it as a straw to drink some tea. The Timtam pretty much melts, so becomes
  messy very quickly, but, having now done it a few times, it is great. They're
  quite a bit better than Penguins because the chocolate tastes a lot better,
  even before it melts.

  Anyway, after a bit of a wander, we found a tasty burger place which,
  presumably, because of the holiday, was out of bread - only low-carb or gluten
  free versions available. Rosie and I ordered sliders which did come with
  high-carb, gluten-rich bread, so they must have run out of larger buns.

  We said our goodbyes to Marianne at the nearest train station, then walked
  back towards Redfern, saying goodbye to Tara and Callum near our Airbnb. We
  packed up our bags ready for an earlier morning for our flight tomorrow.

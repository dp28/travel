  We had another tour booked for today, but starting at the more civilised time
  of 8.30am. When we arrived we were greeted with a lime iced tea at their
  restaurant and told that no one else had booked today, so we had the boat to
  ourselves.

  Like the day before, we walked down to the harbour, but this time got a small
  boat out to where our boat was moored (rather than wedged into the press of
  boats at the jetty). Today's trip was double yesterday's in cost (excluding the
  park fees, which were large), and it showed on the boat. It was the same type,
  but well painted and more comfortable - a larger table, longer benches and
  bean bags towards the back. Like yesterday, there was tea, coffee and water
  provided. In addition, there was a big bunch of ripe green bananas. We didn't
  make much of a dent in them despite my attempts - there's only so many bananas
  one person can eat and for some reason Rosie didn't want any. <R> Nope. </R>

  We had three separate destinations, all for snorkeling and all to the north
  rather than the east, so not in the national park. Our first was around a
  jetty off an island, where we saw plenty of fish of many different kinds. I
  had a bit of difficulty with my mask fogging, but not as bad as yesterday.
  After a while it began to get cold, so we headed back to the boat. Right at
  the jetty we spotted a black moray eel poking out from a crack in the rock
  which (hopefully) we got some half-decent footage of (I was goProing at the
  time). <R> We also saw a huge numner of fish and some great blue starfish, I 
  also a ray but Daniel sadly missed it. </R>

  Our next stop was a tiny little island with a shelf of rock and sandy beach
  with one other boat already there. We snorkeled part way around the island,
  spending most of our time at the wall where the reef descended sharply into
  deeper water. As we were getting in the water Rosie spotted a small shark and
  shot off to film it. <R> It promptly shot off away from me, maybe it is camera
  shy... </R> After some time swimming around and duck diving down to
  get closer to the coral, we began to get cold again and headed towards the
  boat. The water began to heat up a bit, so we spent a bit more time closer to
  shore, then went back to the boat. <R> The area we were swimming around in has
  very strong currents and lots of wierd streams so while one bit of ocean would 
  be freezing the area just next to it would be nice and warm. </R>

  We were served a delicious chicken and coconut milk curry with rice for lunch
  with little biscuits to follow. We had a bit of a lie down on the bean bags
  afterwards as two of the three crew members had a bit of a snooze.

  Our last stop was just off another island, this one just large enough to host
  a small hut and apparently some chickens given the frequent cock-a-doodle-doos
  we heard. There was a line of buoys out to prevent boats going into a
  particular area which we discovered hosted plenty of wire frames with coral
  attached, presumably as an attempt to regrow some of the reef. One of the
  crew members had said that the reef at our first spot used to be better, but
  hadn't had the protection of being in the national park. The coral on the
  frames did seem more vibrant, at least in colour, than elsewhere and was
  covered with fish. I really enjoyed diving down beside the wall and looking
  under the frames to see the large fish there and the tiny ones among the
  coral.

  As we finished snorkeling, a party boat (maybe a liveaboard for divers?)
  pulled up near by, blaring music. We slowly made our way away from them and
  back to Labuan Bajo. Back at port, we said goodbye, showered back at the
  hotel, and went back into town. Rosie was craving some tacos (taco Tuesday -
  I'm impressed I know what day it is), so we went to the town's taqueria.
  Despite quite a tasty papaya salsa, it didn't quite live up to expectations.

  I finished off the day with a bit of diary writing, but didn't quite get up to
  date.

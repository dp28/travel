  I woke up feeling slightly worse than when I went to sleep, as expected from
  plane sleep. Once I'm off the plane I connected to the wifi to check that
  nothing else had gone wrong. Getting stuck in Manchester would have been
  frustrating, but in Abu Dhabi it'd have been down right awkward. Once connected,
  a stream of messages popped up. Uh oh. The last-minute flight was never booked,
  there weren't enough places, so it was canceled. Didn't they know that
  when we booked? Terrible user experience. Bad software design was quite possibly
  the cause. But most importantly, it once again left me without a ticket out of
  Thailand.

  Rosie to the rescue again! She booked a flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, a
  week and a half later. That was a much better idea than my rushed earlier
  attempt. We were planning to return to Thailand later and would have to have
  another proof of exit; that flight could be used as proof of exit both times.

  After another flight with a bad superhero movie and worse sleep, I made it to
  Bangkok. I got my luggage, found the train into the city and got off near the
  centre. After half an hour of wandering around I figured the connecting train
  shown on Google Maps at the airport may no longer exist. Admittedly, there had
  been a warning saying that the schedule may be out of date.

  I wasn't totally sure just how far it would be to walk to my hotel and may have
  been a _little_ intimidated by the idea of trying to cross the incredibly busy
  roads. When a taxi stopped, I told him where I was going and accepted the
  rip-off fare because I really just wanted to get some decent sleep. I got to the
  hotel, checked in, messaged home and Rosie to say I'd made it, then went to
  sleep.

  <R> Meanwhile in China, I landed, stood in a queue to be allowed into the terminal,
  and then stood in a immigration queue followed by a customs queue. I then tried to
  figure out how to get from arrivals to departures (there is one lift that makes the
  journey), stood in a queue to get my ticket issued, proved onward travel and was
  handed a ticket to Thailand (yes!). I then stood in a queue to leave through immigration
  and another to get through security and finally one to get on the plane. China seems
  to really like getting people to queue up. </R>

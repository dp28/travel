  Trying to keep the early mornings going, we woke up at 6.45am again. After
  breakfast, we packed up & checked out of the hotel, leaving our bags there. We
  spent the morning pootering up and down the river on the public boats - a cheap
  and effective means of seeing the city from the water. The boats are long and
  thin - significantly longer than the boarding piers. The entry and exit of the
  boat is at the rear, so the driver cannot position it easily. To help, each of
  the boats has a member of staff at the rear with a whistle to communicate with
  the driver. They produced a whole raft of different noises for various different
  situations, all of which easily cut through the low-pitched engine noises. (I'm
  aware that "driver"and "rear" are unlikely to be the correct terms when on a
  boat, but I find them clearer because they're more general). <R> I found the whistles
  incredibly cool and not dissimilar to the way that a shepherd communicates with
  a sheepdog... does that make us the sheep? </R>


  We then briefly went to see a reasonably low-key Buddhist shrine, at least, in
  comparison to the temples the day before. We had lunch in an enormous food court
  and tried to make our way to Jim Thompson's house. Jim Thompson was an American
  architect turned soldier posted to Thailand at the end of WWII who became a silk
  trader and possibly CIA agent. His house was an interesting mix of Thai and
  European architecture and art.

  We finished the day by picking up our bags and catching the sleeper train to
  Chiang Mai. As I finish writing this, we've just had our curtained-off semi
  compartment changed from two seats and a table into bunk beds and the air
  conditioning is so strong I'm cold for the first time since I arrived. <R>
  I did not expect to be this cold in Thailand, I almost didn't believe the
  train guy when he told me to wrap up warm. </R>

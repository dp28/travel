  We woke up in our "deluxe" room and had a buffet breakfast of fruit, pancakes
  and plenty of deep-fried rice flour donuts. The activity for the day was
  climbing 1,200 steps up to a limestone cave, so after breakfast about 15 of our
  group cycled into the main town to the base of the steps.

  The view as we climbed was impressive - a completely flat valley floor with
  sharp limestone peaks jutting up 400m, fading into cloud. The cave was filled
  with massive stalagmites and smaller stalactites. Apparently an old man had
  lived there until 2002, when it had been opened to tourists.

  After a brief look at the local markets, we cycled back for lunch. We were then
  told that we were actually leaving at 2pm rather than 3pm, so had less than an
  hour of free time. That cut short the time we'd planned to spend cycling by
  ourselves to do a bit more exploring - we only really had time to go to a tour
  office to check the details of our next trip. However, when we arrived back at
  2pm, we ended up sitting at reception until after 3pm. Grumble. <R> Double Grumble. </R>

  After another four hours on a bus, we were back in Hanoi. We'd managed to just
  finish the second last book of the Wheel of Time and were ready for dinner. We
  ended up with some lacklustre banh mi, but made up for them with more delicious
  cream puffs from the Japanese "beard papa" cream puff stall.

  It turns out that despite seeming great, it wasn't the best for uninterrupted
  sleep. It's right beside the island's mosque, so the pre-sunrise adhan being
  called through the minarets woke us both up. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, so
  was able to get back to sleep pretty easily, but unfortunately the same is not
  true for Rosie. We'd only booked two nights here, so I spent a while this
  morning looking for somewhere quieter to spend our last two nights.

  While I was booking that, Rosie did a scuba dive refresher course with one of
  the dive centres on the island. I joined her at 11am to go on a dive along
  with a divemaster from England (who'd studied in Edinburgh). <R> She was
  particularly lovely and made me feel very comfortable, so that was great. </R>

  The dive was great fun - I love the feeling of being weightless, suspended in
  the water. We were taken out on one of the shallow-bottomed local boats with
  large bamboo poles supported far out to either side to provide stability
  without a keel, which made it a little more difficult to maneuver after
  rolling backwards off the boat.

  We saw loads on the coral reef - many species of fish, big and small:
  clownfish, scorpionfish, boxfish, pufferfish, Indian walkman. We saw a huge
  cuttlefish and two species of turtles - green sea turtles and a hawksbill
  turtle. <R> Our dive master was particularly good at finding things for us to
  see and mimed them to us with a particularly entertaining series of signs, for
  example the signal for clownfish is putting your thumb on your nose and 
  wiggling your fingers. </R>

  After coming up we decided to do another dive, so had a pretty quick lunch.
  We realised that diving quite a bit here is going to be pretty expensive, but
  decided that we won't get the opportunity particularly often, so should just
  go for it.

  Our other dive was also fantastic. It was in a similar place, but also
  included a wrecked jetty that sank maybe ten years ago after falling into
  disrepair. Among other things, we saw a lionfish, a tiny bright yellow spotty
  boxfish, two giant frogfish, one painted frogfish and a large shoal of small
  orange fish hidden between two large rocks. <R> The tiny fish are my favourite,
  especially the tiny clown fish that we saw. </R>

  After a dip in their pool, we booked another three dives with the dive centre
  (Blue Marlin), then went back to shower. We had dinner near where we had
  dived, with another sunset behind the volcano, but not as spectacular as last
  night.

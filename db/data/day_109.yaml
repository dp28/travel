  This was Clare and Michael's last day. We swapped some items, Rosie gaining
  her boots and some clothes while they lightened our load by taking back some
  of our souvenirs. We had a few trip admin tasks to take care of (mainly
  laundry), then had a few hours left.

  We drove to another canyon near by and spent a while clambering through a
  long, thin cave (our phone torches came in handy). Nearby were the ruins of a
  fort from before the Spanish conquest, perched on top of the rock at the foot
  of the valley.

  After some souvenir shopping, we had lunch (some the largest slices of quiche
  I've ever seen), then said goodbye to Michael and Clare at our hostel for the
  night. We spent the remainder of the day planning bits of Bolivia, Peru and
  Ecuador, booking a trek in Peru and accommodation in Bolivia. I had a
  disjointed call home over the patchy wifi before an interesting cheap dinner,
  then we got some Bolivian money and turned in for the night.

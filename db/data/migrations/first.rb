    content: %(So, better write this down before I forget it all. I started in Edinburgh,
finishing moving out of my flat by shoving the last few things into my parents'
car (with their help). We managed to squeeze into the jam-packed car to go and
say goodbye to my granny before heading to the airport.

We arrived with over two hours to spare - plenty of time. I tried to check in my
bag through the automated machines (human contact? Not for this software
developer), but it wasn't having any of it. I managed to check in at the manned
desk, but apparently could only get my boarding pass for my first of three
flights (to Manchester). My bag, however, was given passage all the way to
Bangkok.

The flight to Manchester was fine and I was told that I'd be able to pick up my
remaining boarding passes at the gate for my next flight. I passed a couple of
hours programming in a restaurant (chosen because it had a few plug sockets) and
eating a surprisingly good lamb tagine.

When my gate was announced, I packed up, found the gate, and asked the staff for
my boarding cards. They found them and were about to hand them over when one
asked to see my ticket for my onwards journey from Thailand, apparently
necessary before being let into the country. Cue a look of _hopefully_ mild
confusion while my stomach lurches - Rosie and I were planning to leave Thailand
by bus which can only be booked in person in Chiang Mai. Damn.

One of the members of staff recommended a website to book cheap bus tickets, but
it only covered Cambodia. Improvising, I tried to look for flights from Chiang
Mai to Luang Prabang in Laos, near to the next stop on our itinerary. The
airport wifi suddenly seemed so much slower as soon as I needed it to work.
Luckily, Rosie phoned to check how the first leg of my journey was going and I
told her what had happened. Because both my internet connection and the queue to
board the plane was dwindling to nothing, Rosie found and booked both of us on a
flight to Luang Prabang. Unfortunately, there weren't many left and we would
have to fly through Bangkok. Worse, the confirmation email was just a proof of
purchase, not a booking. The booking email would be sent "within the next four
hours". Great.

Thankfully, the airline officials accepted the proof of purchase email. I was
the last to get on the plane and my heart rate returned to normal. I sat back,
relaxed, watched some crappy superhero movie until the in-air entertainment
system failed and I managed to get some sleep (thank you, travel pillow).)

    content: %(I woke up feeling slightly worse than when I went to sleep, as expected from
plane sleep. Once I'm off the plane I connected to the wifi to check that
nothing else had gone wrong. Getting stuck in Manchester would have been
frustrating, but in Abu Dhabi it'd have been down right awkward. Once connected,
a stream of messages popped up. Uh oh. The last-minute flight was never booked,
there weren't enough places, so it was cancelled. Didn't they know that
when we booked? Terrible user experience. Bad software design was quite possibly
the cause. But most importantly, it once again left me without a ticket out of
Thailand.

Rosie to the rescue again! She booked a flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, a
week and a half later. That was a much better idea than my rushed earlier
attempt. We were planning to return to Thailand later and would have to have
another proof of exit; that flight could be used as proof of exit both times.

After another flight with a bad superhero movie and worse sleep, I made it to
Bangkok. I got my luggage, found the train into the city and got off near the
centre. After half an hour of wandering around I figured the connecting train
shown on Google Maps at the airport may no longer exist. Admittedly, there had
been a warning saying that the schedule may be out of date.

I wasn't totally sure just how far it would be to walk to my hotel and may have
been a _little_ intimidated by the idea of trying to cross the incredibly busy
roads. When a taxi stopped, I told him where I was going and accepted the
rip-off fare because I really just wanted to get some decent sleep. I got to the
hotel, checked in, messaged home and Rosie to say I'd made it, then went to
sleep.)

    content: %(I woke up at 4am Bangkok time, 11am UK time. That was probably jet lag. I've yet
to experience jet lag particularly badly - I just rolled over, went back to
sleep and woke up again six hours later.

Our booking included breakfast, so I helped myself to pastries, jam, orange
juice and a bowl of cornflakes. The milk was definitely UHT but I happen to
think that one of the two ways UHT milk tastes good is on cornflakes (the other,
obviously, being drunk straight from the 5ml plastic containers that are
_possibly_ intended to be used for take away tea & coffee).

I spent the next couple of hours reading the Bangkok section of our guidebook
and a bit of the cookery-slanted South East Asia travel book I was reading.
Rosie arrived in the early afternoon, dumped her stuff, showered, and we headed
out into Bangkok.

To get a bit of background on Thailand, we went to the guidebook-recommended
Museum of Siam. The museum was primarily focussed on trying to determine "What
is Thainess", highlighting the importance of the nation, religion and monarchy
to its people. The exhibits in each of the 17 rooms were different in style,
quite interactive and (mostly) in English. For me, the best and strangest room
was the one trying to determine how Thai certain outfits were by ranking them in
a pyramid formation. Some of these seemed clear after earlier parts of the
museum, such as Rama being the most Thai and formal Thai costume being fairly
high up. But what are "Bike for Mom" and "Bike for Dad" t-shirts and why are
they even higher? I'm pretty sure I'd never see a similar display in a British
museum - I doubt there is a politically-correct way to determine how British
something is, especially in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Afterwards, we made our way back to our hotel, the Hotel Royal Bangkok. It was
on one of the main streets of Chinatown, blazing with the neon glow from the
multitude of signs. It turned out our hotel was bang in the centre of the street
food stalls in Chinatown, making it perfect for dinner. We wandered around to
choose a few, settling on shredded duck rolls, deep-fried vegetable spring
rolls and surprisingly good deep-fried noodles & sweet chilli dip. We also got
got several things from a man frying small bundles of food wrapped in bacon and
served on cocktail sticks, mainly different types of mushrooms but also some
tasty asparagus.

We finished the day with a cocktail each in the rooftop bar of our hotel.
Apparently it was a pool party but everyone seemed to be ignoring both the pool
and the blaring music. The night skyline of Bangkok, however, was spectacular.)

    content: %(To try and capitalise on our (Rosie's) jet lag, we got up at 6.45am to get out
early. Unfortunately, we lost a bit of time booking the train for Chiang Mai the
next day, but then went down to breakfast. I tried out some of the Thai food on
offer - rice and several stews with some chilli sauce.

Today was our day for seeing some of the main recommended sights of Bangkok -
the Grand Palace and Wat Pho. The Grand Palace is a former residence of the Thai
monarchy and also houses the Emerald Buddha (which isn't made from emerald). The
palace complex is huge and the buildings are incredibly ornate and covered in
gold. For me, the most interesting (and least crowded) parts were Chakri
Mahaprasat - a Western-style building with a Thai roof - and a smaller museum of
items donated to the Buddha, which includes models of what the complex looked
like when it was built in 1782 and what it is like now.

We then went to Wat Pho, a temple with a huge reclining Buddha, more intricate
decorations and a functioning primary school. It was recommended more than the
Grand Palace primarily for its impressive Buddha and smaller crowds, but the
significantly cheaper entry price and free water were greatly appreciated.

We haggled our way onto a tuk tuk to Siam Square and bought lunch at the food
court in the huge MBK centre. From there, we caught the Skytrain (similar to
the subway, but built at a level **above** the cars) to Chatuchak weekend
market. The market was _huge_, a maze of stalls selling anything and
everything, from a plethora of tourist tat to pet cats.

Somewhat overwhelmed and overheated, we settled down by a lake in an adjacent
park to relax for a bit. We were facinated and somewhat revolted by the size of
the catfish which fought over the food being thrown into the lake by people near
by. After a while, we made our way back to the hotel on the subway. We finished
off the night with street food and chilling in the rooftop bar.)

    content: %(Trying to keep the early mornings going, we woke up at 6.45am again. After
breakfast, we packed up & checked out of the hotel, leaving our bags there. We
spent the morning pootering up and down the river on the public boats - a cheap
and effective means of seeing the city from the water. The boats are long and
thin - significantly longer than the boarding piers. The entry and exit of the
boat is at the rear, so the driver cannot position it easily. To help, each of
the boats has a member of staff at the rear with a whistle to communicate with
the driver. They produced a whole raft of different noises for various different
situations, all of which easily cut through the low-pitched engine noises. (I'm
aware that "driver"and "rear"are unlikely to be the correct terms when on a
boat, but I find them clearer because they're more general).

We then briefly went to see a reasonably low-key buddhist shrine, at least, in
comparison to the temples the day before. We had lunch in an enormous food court
and tried to make our way to Jim Thompson's house. Jim Thompson was an American
architect turned soldier posted to Thailand at the end of WWII who became a silk
trader and possibly CIA agent. His house was an iteresting mix of Thai and
european architecture and art.

We finished the day by picking up our bags and catching the sleeper train to
Chiang Mai. As I finish writing this, we've just had our curtained-off semi
compartment changed from two seats and a table into bunk beds and the air
conditioning is so strongs I'm cold for the first time since I arrived.)

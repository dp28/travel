:entry: "It turns out there isn't much to do in Sandakan itself. We decided to get
  the\nbus out to Sepilok again, this time to see the Rainforest Discovery Centre.\nUnlike
  the previous day, the drive there was hair-raising. It would have been\nperfectly
  normal in Cambodia - the driver accelerated at every possible point,\nweaving around
  other vehicles to move into whichever lane had any space or\neven the hard shoulder.
  No other vehicles seem to drive like that here. <R> No \none else seemed fussed
  though. </R>\n\nAfter a shorter than expected time, we arrived near the Centre.
  We walked into\nit and found it was almost deserted. It's primary focus is education
  of local\npeople, then tourism, so with the orangutan and sun bear centres so close
  it's\nnot that surprising it was pretty empty. <R> We were more than ok with the
  lack\nof people. </R>\n\nWe spent most of the day making our way slowly around the
  grounds of the Centre,\nstopping in a couple of towers and on the canopy walk to
  look for wildlife. We\nheard plenty of birds and saw a few (one particularly impressive
  broadbill) and\na giant squirrel (the size of a cat with a huge tail). We also saw
  plenty of\ninvertebrates - huge butterflies, a colony of ants crossing the path,
  and\nseveral things that looked like woodlice, but ten times the size, with red
  edges\nand moved very slowly. We even saw a freshwater crab in a small stream.\n\nThe
  plant life was amazing. Huge trees, some with bright red fruits we couldn't\nidentify
  hanging from their trunks. Up on the canopy walk, we were able to\neasily see the
  top-most branches of the trees near us. There are also apparently\nhundreds of species
  of orchids, but we didn't see that many.\n\nWe walked to the orangutan centre to
  try and get a minibus that was supposed to\ngo at 2.30pm or 3pm, but it never showed
  up. We waited for the last bus of the\nday (4pm) and had the same driver as in the
  morning. This time, he was\nremarkably sane until the last five minutes.\n\nWe had
  a better dinner at the same place we went the night before (it looked\nlike the
  best place in town and I possibly wanted to try their salted caramel\ncheesecake).
  We wanted to spend the evening booking the next few steps in our\ntrip, but were
  too frustrated by the glacial speed of the internet in our hostel\nto book more
  than our next few nights.\n"

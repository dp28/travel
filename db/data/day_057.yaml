  It turns out there isn't much to do in Sandakan itself. We decided to get the
  bus out to Sepilok again, this time to see the Rainforest Discovery Centre.
  Unlike the previous day, the drive there was hair-raising. It would have been
  perfectly normal in Cambodia - the driver accelerated at every possible point,
  weaving around other vehicles to move into whichever lane had any space or
  even the hard shoulder. No other vehicles seem to drive like that here. <R> No
  one else seemed fussed though. </R>

  After a shorter than expected time, we arrived near the Centre. We walked into
  it and found it was almost deserted. It's primary focus is education of local
  people, then tourism, so with the orangutan and sun bear centres so close it's
  not that surprising it was pretty empty. <R> We were more than ok with the lack
  of people. </R>

  We spent most of the day making our way slowly around the grounds of the Centre,
  stopping in a couple of towers and on the canopy walk to look for wildlife. We
  heard plenty of birds and saw a few (one particularly impressive broadbill) and
  a giant squirrel (the size of a cat with a huge tail). We also saw plenty of
  invertebrates - huge butterflies, a colony of ants crossing the path, and
  several things that looked like woodlice, but ten times the size, with red edges
  and moved very slowly. We even saw a freshwater crab in a small stream.

  The plant life was amazing. Huge trees, some with bright red fruits we couldn't
  identify hanging from their trunks. Up on the canopy walk, we were able to
  easily see the top-most branches of the trees near us. There are also apparently
  hundreds of species of orchids, but we didn't see that many.

  We walked to the orangutan centre to try and get a minibus that was supposed to
  go at 2.30pm or 3pm, but it never showed up. We waited for the last bus of the
  day (4pm) and had the same driver as in the morning. This time, he was
  remarkably sane until the last five minutes.

  We had a better dinner at the same place we went the night before (it looked
  like the best place in town and I possibly wanted to try their salted caramel
  cheesecake). We wanted to spend the evening booking the next few steps in our
  trip, but were too frustrated by the glacial speed of the internet in our hostel
  to book more than our next few nights.

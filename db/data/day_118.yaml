  Breakfast was provided by our hotel, but was relatively simple. This probably
  shouldn't be that surprising as we learnt later that people here typically
  eat five times a day (yes, people in Bolivia do seem to be somewhat rounder
  than in Chile and Argentine, but that is also partly due to that being
  attractive in some indigenous groups).

  We spent the morning seeing La Paz by teleferico (cable car). These are a
  pretty cheap form of public transport ($0.40/Â£0.30) built in 2014 and being
  extended that give great views over the city. They also really made us
  question why anyone would build a city here (answer: originally, gold was
  found in the river in the valley). La Paz really does seem to be a unique
  city - at such a high altitude, surrounded by steep, snow-covered mountains
  and sharp rock formations. The telefericos just accentuate it.

  We planned to join a walking tour so didn't have long for lunch. We ended up
  stumbling upon a great place for choripan - the sausage-in-a-bun snack that
  we'd first had in Argentina, but somehow a lot better here, I'm not sure why.
  Topped off with a dulce de leche filled donut and some strawberry yoghurt, it
  was a good lunch.

  The walking tour pointed out some of the weirder aspects of La Paz. First
  there was the prison where inmates run the prison and have to pay for
  everything, so have jobs inside and even their families live inside. Some
  prisoners used to charge people to give them tours (possibly with cocaine),
  but these are now illegal.

  Another odd part was the witches' market - a mixture of tourist tat and things
  used for rituals by indigenous people. For example, for small constructions
  like shops it is customary to get an offering of sugar, alcohol and a llama
  foetus and bury it all in the foundations to prevent bad things happening
  during the construction. Apparently larger constructions may require human
  sacrifice and while this is obviously illegal it isn't really known whether
  it still happens, but we were warned against getting blind drunk or accepting
  food or drink from strangers in case we end up being buried alive as a
  sacrifice ...

  After the tour we had a bit of a wander (Rosie bought an alpaca sweater), then
  had a beer and a cocktail from the national spirit, singani. It was good we
  were inside - it began to bucket with hail and snow mixed in. We watched the
  traffic and noticed that the majority of vehicles are taxis or minibuses,
  which is fair enough, driving up these hills doesn't look like fun.

  We then joined a food tour by the same company as our earlier tour with one
  of the same guides. Because it is May Day, lots of places are closed, so a
  couple of courses weren't included in the tour, but we still finished stuffed.
  We had a lot of food, all pretty good:

  * **Pastel** - a  deep fried cheese pastry typically covered in icing sugar (better than it sounds)
  * **Api** - a warm, sweet white or purple corn drink, spiced with clove and maybe cinnamon
  * **Llajwa** - a spicy tomato sauce or dip served with most restaurant meals
  * **Singani sour** - like a Pisco sour, but with Singani (we got to mix one ourselves)
  * **Pique macho** - A massive pile of chips, beef, sausage, bolied egg, cheese and spicy sauce

  We also had some Bolivian versions of popular food and drink - Bolivian beer,
  wine, brownies (ie, with quinoa) and apple crumble (also with quinoa). Since
  the growth in popularity of quinoa in the UK and US, it's more expensive here
  and harder to get - our guide said he used to have it four times a week in his
  childhood but now only once a month.

  We got a taxi back to the hotel because most people don't recommend walking
  after dark. We're only supposed to get taxis with phone numbers on the side
  and signs on top - the others are apparently not trustworthy. It's amazing
  how normal it now seems that taxis don't have working seatbelts, too ...

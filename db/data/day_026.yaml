  It turns out our room did have a waterproof roof - at least, this morning's downpour didn't soak us.
  We got up after it finished, paid and left, walking a mile or two into town with our rucksacks.
  Rosie had found us an excellent breakfast restaurant and I had a fantastic meal of French toast and
  bananas covered in sugar cane caramel. The baguettes they do here have much softer crusts than a
  French baguette at home and lend themselves really well to French toast. The breakfast shake
  (banana, peanut butter, honey, cinnamon, oats) may have been a bit much, but was interesting.

  Our main activity for the day was getting to Kep, another coastal town 15 - 20 miles away. We hopped
  into a (remarkably comfy) tuk tuk and asked to stop at La Plantation, a pepper farm on the way. At
  least, it wasn't particularly near by either Kampot or Kep, but close enough. We turned off the
  tarmac road onto smaller, bumpier dirt tracks through currently empty rice paddies with the
  occasional cow, pig or chicken and chicks. <R> I am not sure that Daniel is accurately describing
  the feeling of being bounced along in the back of trailer concerned that at any moment the whole thing
  could just collapse around you... but hey there were puppies everywhere so I was happy. </R>


  Our driver stopped at a large building on the edge of a farm where we were able to get a (free!)
  tour. La Plantation is run by a French and Belgian couple, growing primarily Kampot pepper, which
  is one of the main products of the region. We saw plenty of it growing, along with specimens of
  bananas, pineapples, papayas, passion fruit, turmeric and bird chillis. We also learnt the
  differences between different pepper types and got to taste them all. We even tried Kamport pepper
  ice cream, which, surprisingly, wasn't bad (at least in small amounts).

  Afterwards, we went the rest of the way to Kep in our tuk tuk and checked in at our (nicer) hotel.
  We wandered into town and had a cocktail at the local sailing club while watching the sunset. We had
  dinner at a Spanish restaurant and probably witnessed a typical scene for a European expat living
  out their dream of opening a small restaurant in South East Asia - everything a little bit too
  hectic for him and the single other member of staff to handle, even with only three or four tables.
  The water hadn't been working for the previous two days, but was now fixed, and half the food on the
  menu wasn't actually available. The food itself was ok, not great, but it was fun to see and
  slightly reminiscent of Fawlty Towers. We also got chatting to an Austrian couple who'd been
  traveling a lot.

  ## Pepper types

  * *Red*: ripe pepper picked, boiled & sundried
  * *White*: peeled red pepper
  * *Black*: not as ripe pepper picked when green, boiled & sundried
  * *Long*: a different type of pepper, originally from Java rather than India. Shaped like a bumpy chilli (I prefer this one).
  * *Pearl*: the seeds within the long pepper

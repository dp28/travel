  We made our morning flight to Santa Cruz, despite a badly-calculated morning
  alarm, miscalculated amount of time to get to the airport and (initially)
  slow taxi driver. The flight was short, but came with free dried fruit (which
  was a bit weird).

  Our taxi dropped us off at a dingy hostel and neither of us had particularly
  great first impressions of Santa Cruz. Most of what there is to do here is get
  tours of the nearby national parks and we learnt today that most of those
  tour operators don't open at the weekends (ie, while we're here) - maybe this
  was a bit of a mistake. Ah well.

  We had lunch out, then spent the afternoon trying to get the diary back on
  track. It is woefully behind (multiple weeks). We had dinner at yet another
  deserted restaurant (we seem to eat at the wrong time). The star of the show
  was a tricolour gnocchi - made with three different colours of potatoes rather
  than dyed with spinach, beetroot or squid ink as I've seen before.

  We were given a decent breakfast by the hotel, including dulce de leche as a
  spread to put on our toast. Buenos Aires seems to be crazy for this stuff -
  it's in about half of their desserts.

  We spent the morning looking up what to do in Buenos Aires, settling on a
  walking tour for today. Beforehand, we had some routine tasks to complete -
  find an ATM with money in it, get laundry done, etc. Leaving to do these
  things, I wasn't able to find my hat anywhere, so must have lost it somewhere
  last night. I've had it for a few years, it's got a decent brim and is
  waterproof, so would be hard to replace ... <R> He was very very upset about
  the loss of his hat, apparently it has sentimental value. </R>

  We had a long walk to a cheap street food street, where we got a couple of
  classic meat sandwiches (one bacon or "bondiola", one sausage or "choripan")
  which we could then top up with veg from a variety of bowls. We had a look
  around an old ship, now a museum, that had been used on voyages to the
  Antartic but now sits in one of the harbours. <R> I had a lot of fun playing
  with the photo translate function of the google translate app. My spanish is
  ok but they never taught me what a iron wrench was in spanish class. Plus the
  app is cool. </R>

  We then went on a walking tour which was great. It was focused on the cultural side of Buenos
  Aires rather than the political and historical side. That being said, it
  started at a statue of San Martin, the liberator of Argentina (and close to
  half of the rest of South America). Our guide pointed out that people from
  Buenos Aires (porteños) are prone to exaggeration, of which the statue is an
  example. The horse has two legs off the ground, which should apparently mean
  that the person died in battle, but San Martin did not.

  Next to the park with this statue were two very different monuments to
  Argentina's relationship with the UK. The first is "pequeño Big Ben", a clock
  tower given as a gift from the UK to Argentina in honour of the centenary of
  its independence (it's very different in style from Big Ben). Nearby and
  facing it is the Malvinas (Falkland Island) War memorial. It had fresh flowers
  and apparently normally has two guards, but possibly they had the day off.
  Yesterday was a public holiday commemorating the war, which seems to be fresh
  in everyone's minds - they're taught in school that the Malvinas are part of
  Argentina (along with a fair hunk of Antartica) and Malvinas veterans get
  reduced fares on public transport. <R> I'm not sure at what point argentinian
  adults learn that the Malvinas are not argentinian, our guide spoke as thought
  it was common knowledge but if they learn it in school, at what point are they
  notified of the truth. </R>

  Our guide (and quite a few people we've met since) talked quite a lot about
  the "golden age" of Argentina, roughly from the 1880s to the 1930s or 1940s.
  During this time, Argentina exported a lot of beef (their main export now is
  soya to feed other people's beef catle herds) and encouraged immigration from
  Europe. A small number of families owned a lot of the land and became very
  wealthy. They toured Europe frequently and that influence can be seen in the
  many French-style palacios dotted about the city. We saw eight on the tour and
  in total there are close to 40 left standing of the original 108. Most of the
  materials for the buildings came from Europe along with their architects.

  Buenos Aires definitely seems wealthy compared to South East Asia, but also
  quite focused on how good things used to be. Admittedly, given some of their
  high import taxes and high inflation rate (apparently 50% two years ago and
  25% last year), I can kind of see why. It feels pretty European, or maybe
  American due to the grid system of the roads. Almost all the streets are one
  way or very, very wide, but many people have told us to beware of the crazy
  drivers. We haven't seen any evidence of this to speak of - definitely not
  compared to South East Asia. People pay attention to traffic lights here, if
  not stop signs, and one way does mean one way, not just one way for cars, two
  ways for motorbikes.

  We had a bit of a wait after the tour until dinner because restaurants don't
  open until 7.30pm - 8.30pm here. We wandered around a park at the end of the
  tour in the upmarket Recoleta district. We've been trying to follow a basic
  exercise regime for the last few weeks and so did so today in an outdoor gym.

  Our guide had recommended a place nearby for empanadas (small pasties that are
  extremely popular here), so we shared four, all with different fillings. I had
  another local delicacy for dessert: an alfajor, basically two crumbly biscuits
  joined by a layer of dulce de leche. Rosie had a "lemon pie cake", which
  turned out to be almost cake-like pastry, a layer of lemon and at least five
  centimetres of meringue - apparently that's how they like it here. <R> Daniel
  ate most of the meringue. </R>

  Pretty tired by this point, we made our way back, buying a bottle of red wine
  and some Dairy Milk on the way (unfortunately not as good as home ...).

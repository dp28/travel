  So, better write this down before I forget it all. I started in Edinburgh,
  finishing moving out of my flat by shoving the last few things into my parents'
  car (with their help). We managed to squeeze into the jam-packed car to go and
  say goodbye to my granny before heading to the airport.

  We arrived with over two hours to spare - plenty of time. I tried to check in my
  bag through the automated machines (human contact? Not for this software
  developer), but it wasn't having any of it. I managed to check in at the manned
  desk, but apparently could only get my boarding pass for my first of three
  flights (to Manchester). My bag, however, was given passage all the way to
  Bangkok.

  The flight to Manchester was fine and I was told that I'd be able to pick up my
  remaining boarding passes at the gate for my next flight. I passed a couple of
  hours programming in a restaurant (chosen because it had a few plug sockets) and
  eating a surprisingly good lamb tagine.

  When my gate was announced, I packed up, found the gate, and asked the staff for
  my boarding cards. They found them and were about to hand them over when one
  asked to see my ticket for my onwards journey from Thailand, apparently
  necessary before being let into the country. Cue a look of _hopefully_ mild
  confusion while my stomach lurches - Rosie and I were planning to leave Thailand
  by bus which can only be booked in person in Chiang Mai. Damn.

  One of the members of staff recommended a website to book cheap bus tickets, but
  it only covered Cambodia. Improvising, I tried to look for flights from Chiang
  Mai to Luang Prabang in Laos, near to the next stop on our itinerary. The
  airport wifi suddenly seemed so much slower as soon as I needed it to work.
  Luckily, Rosie phoned to check how the first leg of my journey was going and I
  told her what had happened. Because both my internet connection and the queue to
  board the plane was dwindling to nothing, Rosie found and booked both of us on a
  flight to Luang Prabang. Unfortunately, there weren't many left and we would
  have to fly through Bangkok. Worse, the confirmation email was just a proof of
  purchase, not a booking. The booking email would be sent "within the next four
  hours". Great.

  Thankfully, the airline officials accepted the proof of purchase email. I was
  the last to get on the plane and my heart rate returned to normal. I sat back,
  relaxed, watched some crappy superhero movie until the in-air entertainment
  system failed and I managed to get some sleep (thank you, travel pillow).

  <R> Meanwhile in California I received a rather panicked phone call from Daniel
  informing me that he needed to prove onward travel from Thailand or they wouldn't
  let him on the plane! I quickly tried to book the flight that Dan had told me to
  first trying the airline website only to be told that was only one seat, well that
  was no good, we needed two... I tried a booking site for the same flight and it went
  through or at least they sent us a confirmation email, Dan made it on the plane.

  Panic over, crisis averted... not so fast. I logged into the booking site in the car
  on the way to LA and found that the tickets hadn't been issued there was in fact only
  one seat, I was unimpressed. This now left me stuck I didn't have any proof of onwards
  travel and besides we were going to be flying back into Thailand from Laos, would we
  need to prove onward travel then, would one ticket do both jobs. I hoped so and booked
  a flight from Thailand to Cambodia from Bangkok air, or at least I thought I did, the
  credit card didn't go through. So I called them, they don't accept card payments over
  the phone, I would need to fax them my credit card (what?!) I tried another booking site,
  although I will admit I was skeptical of them at this point, and this one worked. Or at
  least I was issued both a ticket and they charged my card. I then proceeded to have a
  lovely lunch in LA followed by a visit to the very cool Getty art gallery and then
  an equally lovely dinner before heading to LAX.

  At LAX they didn't seem fussed about onward travel although they only issued my
  ticket as far as China which I will admit concerned me. After standing in 4 very long queues
  I made it onto the plane, watched Goodbye Christopher Robin and fell asleep for
  most of the remaining 10 hours. I was a little bit fed up with airline booking
  sites at this point. </R>

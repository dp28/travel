  I woke up at 4am Bangkok time, 11am UK time. That was probably jet lag. I've yet
  to experience jet lag particularly badly - I just rolled over, went back to
  sleep and woke up again six hours later.

  Our booking included breakfast, so I helped myself to pastries, jam, orange
  juice and a bowl of cornflakes. The milk was definitely UHT but I happen to
  think that one of the two ways UHT milk tastes good is on cornflakes (the other,
  obviously, being drunk straight from the 5ml plastic containers that are
  _possibly_ intended to be used for take away tea & coffee).

  I spent the next couple of hours reading the Bangkok section of our guidebook
  and a bit of the cookery-slanted South East Asia travel book I was reading.
  Rosie arrived in the early afternoon, dumped her stuff, showered, and we headed
  out into Bangkok. <R> My stuff was delicately placed not dumped. </R>

  To get a bit of background on Thailand, we went to the guidebook-recommended
  Museum of Siam. The museum was primarily focused on trying to determine "What
  is Thainess", highlighting the importance of the nation, religion and monarchy
  to its people. The exhibits in each of the 17 rooms were different in style,
  quite interactive and (mostly) in English. For me, the best and strangest room
  was the one trying to determine how Thai certain outfits were by ranking them in
  a pyramid formation. Some of these seemed clear after earlier parts of the
  museum, such as Rama being the most Thai and formal Thai costume being fairly
  high up. But what are "Bike for Mom" and "Bike for Dad" t-shirts and why are
  they even higher? I'm pretty sure I'd never see a similar display in a British
  museum - I doubt there is a politically-correct way to determine how British
  something is, especially in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

  Afterwards, we made our way back to our hotel, the Hotel Royal Bangkok. It was
  on one of the main streets of Chinatown, blazing with the neon glow from the
  multitude of signs. It turned out our hotel was bang in the centre of the street
  food stalls in Chinatown, making it perfect for dinner. We wandered around to
  choose a few, settling on shredded duck rolls, deep-fried vegetable spring
  rolls and surprisingly good deep-fried noodles & sweet chilli dip. We also got
  got several things from a man frying small bundles of food wrapped in bacon and
  served on cocktail sticks, mainly different types of mushrooms but also some
  tasty asparagus.

  We finished the day with a cocktail each in the rooftop bar of our hotel.
  Apparently it was a pool party but everyone seemed to be ignoring both the pool
  and the blaring music. The night skyline of Bangkok, however, was spectacular.

  Somewhat disgruntled, we were herdedoff our long distance bus onto a minibus
  at 5am, only to realise that our hostel was just around the corner and we
  could have walked there faster. Someone sleepily let us in, but check in had
  to wait until 7am, which is fair enough. Rosie tried unsuccessfully to sleep
  on a small sofa while I spent the time programming until we could check in and
  were given a room.

  We ventured out tothe local market for breakfast, getting a couple of large
  portions of fruit blended with evaporated milk as we had had in Bolivia (just
  more expensive). We came back to the hotel and found that the showers were
  lukewarm at best ...

  We went out for lunch to a cheap place with a set two-course lunch, but after
  a soup of potatoes, rice and a bit of meat we were already full (well, almost
  - we still had space for some apple pie).

  We joined a walking tour for the remainder of the afternoon. The guide seemed
  somewhat distracted, so it wasn't the best tour we've been on, but it was
  fine. We saw the huge white cathedral and many old, white buildings built from
  sillar, a white volcanic stone, and had some great views of the three massive
  volcanoes nearby. Arequipa is only at 2,300m while some of the volcanoes are
  above 6,000m, so they're pretty intimidating. We saw alpacas and llamas and
  our guide explained the differences between them and vicuñas (focussing on the
  fact that vicuñas produce the finest fabric and are endangered, so the fabric
  is very expensive and you get five years in prison for killing one). We tried
  a local corn dirnk and a beer, then some local ice cream. The speciality is
  "helado queso", or cheese ice cream, but it is actually flavoured with
  vanilla, cinnamon and maybe some honey or other spices. The reference to
  cheese is to do with the look and method of production, apparently, much to
  the bewilderment of one of the Dutch guys on the tour who just couldn't
  comprehend this.

  We had another great dinner - Rosie had duck with raspberry sauce while I had
  beef with blue cheese sauce, both delicious. The one waiter for the restaurant
  was fantasitc, making all the drinks and gave Rosie a huge glass of wine
  because there was only about a glass anda half left in the bottle. We finished
  just after 8pm, but were exhausted so almost immediately went to sleep when
  we got back to the hotel.

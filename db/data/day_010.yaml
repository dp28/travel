  The main activity today was going to meet some elephants. It's a popular thing to do in Chiang Mai
  and was really interesting. There are loads of places that do it with very similar descriptions so
  we'd spent some time having a look for one with good reviews that didn't include anything else
  (unlike our first tour).

  We were picked up by a songthaew at 7am and driven, along with six other tourists, two hours out of
  the city. A songthaew is one of the many adaptations of the Thai pickup truck - in this case, it's a
  standard pickup with a roof over the back and a bench along each wall. I'm sure the breeze in the
  open back is normally both refreshing and exhilarating, but unfortunately the weather wasn't any
  better than yesterday so we were all soon pretty cold.

  Once we got to the elephants, the day got better. There were two of them, both very calm but also
  impressive. We fed them sugar cane which allowed them to show their ingenuity - the male, Jimmy,
  stuffed a bit of sugar cane behind his tusk to maximise the amount he could get while storing some
  for later. We then walked for about ten to twenty minutes to a river where we (mainly Rosie) gave
  the elephants a mud bath, covering them in mud, then throwing water at them when they went into the
  river. <R> They were just such massive animals that it was hilarious to see Jimmy wander into the river
  and roll around like a dog </R>

  We were pretty tired once we got back to Chiang Mai. We had thought about going to a temple out of
  town that supposedly was a great viewpoint, but it was still very cloudy so we opted for a walk
  around the city walls. We ended up chilling beside a pond in a park with a couple of ice creams,
  followed up an hour later by a surprisingly large banana milkshake (served in a jug, not a glass).

  By chance, one of Rosie's friends from our halls in St Andrews, Tara, happened to have arrived in
  Chiang Mai within the last day or two. We met up for dinner today with her and her boyfriend to
  catch up. They'd been traveling for the past two or three months in many of the countries we are
  about to go to, so gave us plenty of tips. We had a great meal swapping stories, then headed back to
  pack up, ready for our bus in the morning.

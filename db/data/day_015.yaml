  We woke up (if you can call the brief spells of unconsciousness the night before "sleep") at 5.30am
  as the bus arrived. We shared a songthaew into town, dropped off our bags at our guest house, then
  walked into the centre. <R> My bad night was made even worse by the fact that I had picked up a cold
  the day before which had steadily developed over the course of the night to be a full blown case of
  the sniffles. </R>

  One of the main things to do in Luang Prabang, apparently, is to watch the alms giving at dawn. As I
  was told by culturally insensitive American who wishes to remain nameless, alms giving is distinct
  from thanksgiving by the lack of turkey. It also involves considerably more Buddhist monks. It was
  as described - lines of monks walking the main street, being given food by others and photographed
  by tourists. <R> It was **very** early in the morning. </R>

  We managed to find somewhere opening for breakfast, then went to the UXO information centre. "UXO"
  is short for UneXploded Ordinance - a problem that Laos, the most heavily bombed country per capita
  in the world, suffers from daily. It was a fascinating, if harrowing, exhibition.

  We were then able to check in to our guest house and use the wifi to decide on what to do for the
  rest of the day. We found somewhere with a great sounding lunch that didn't disappoint, then caught
  another songthaew, then boat, to a nearby waterfall. Because it's the dry season, the waterfall
  wasn't particularly impressive, but we were able to have a bit of a (chilly) swim.

  Back in Luang Prabang, we waited for the sunset beside the Mekong, then wandered through the night
  market. We weren't massively hungry, but couldn't say no to some street food. By far the best were
  some small coconut pancakes / dumplings made in large dishes with ladle-sized indents, similar to
  Dutch pancakes but far more moist.

  Returning early to our room, we caught up with home, work and sleep, despite thin walls and the
  dulcet tones of a guitar-playing fellow guest. <R> Literally every other note was wrong. </R>

:entry: "More fantastic, cheap Indian food from the hawker stalls for breakfast. If
  you\nlived in Singapore it's probably not worth cooking - so much great choice is\navailable
  for so little money relative to how much people make. This morning\nwe had a dosa
  and a biryani (briyani here). So good, but I ended up very full.\n\nAs we were getting
  food it began to rain, with ominous clouds promising more\nlater in the day. Our
  plan was to go on a walking tour, so we definitely\nneeded some cover. Unfortunately,
  while packing the bag for the day our water\nhad leaked, drenching my coat. So,
  after breakfast, we picked up Rosie's coat\nand bought me a lovely bright blue poncho
  for $1 so that all of Singapore\ncould identify me more easily as a tourist. <R>
  He only had to wear it for like \n15 minutes... Besides I think the whole world
  knows that Daniel is a tourist\neven without the poncho. </R>\n\nWe took the subway
  (MRT here) to the centre of town to join our\npay-what-you-want walking tour called
  Sneak Peak Singapore. We joined a group\nof about 20 others with our guide being
  a young local guy of Chinese descent\nin a pink t-shirt. He'd recently finished
  his degree in urban planning and now\nworked for the government planning department,
  which definitely coloured the\ncontent of the tour. Not that I'm complaining; the
  planned-out nature of\nSingapore and it's development was fascinating to learn about.\n\nWe
  started by the river with a brief intro to the early history of Singapore\n700 years
  ago, then skipped to the start of British influence in the early\n19th century.
  Darren, our guide, explained the politics of the area at the\ntime and how the British
  asked for a trading port in Singapore after lending\nmilitary aid to an elder brother
  of the ruling family of the Johore Sultanate\nwho's younger brother had taken the
  throne. They'd then not charged any tax\nat the port, enabling it to outcompete
  the Dutch ports in the same area (the\nStraits of Melacca). <R> This was all explained
  with the help of a map and some\nlaminated pictures that he pulled from his magical
  bag. </R>\n\nWe then made our way through Chinatown, learning plenty as we went.
  It is\nfairly central, so is surrounded by skyscrapers, but four of its districts\nhave
  been preserved with the old two to five storey shophouses. They're\npretty thin
  as the colonial government used to tax buildings by the width of\ntheir shopfront
  on the main street, not by area, leading to long, thin\nbuildings up to five times
  longer than they were wide. <R> At this point it \nbegan to rain so we all pulled
  on coats and ponchos and for those that didn't \nhave a poncho with them Darren
  pulled about a dozen of them from his magical\nbag. It only rained for about 15
  minutes though which was nice because when it \ndid rain, it rained really heavily.
  </R>\n\nDarren also pointed out the original shore line of Singapore, now two\nkilometres
  from the sea. Huge amounts of Singapore are built on reclaimed land\n- something
  like 25%. The earth came from hills, many of which used to be in\nChinatown. These
  used to give rise to a large number of wells, forming the\ncity's primary water
  source. Water was transported in barrels on oxcarts and\nwas so common that it affects
  the area's name even now. In many other cities,\nthe Chinatown is called something
  like \\\"Chinese street\\\" in Chinese, but here\nit is the three words \\\"ox\\\",
  \\\"water\\\" and \\\"cart\\\" (I forget the ordering). <R> At \nthis point it was
  getting rather hot so Darren pulled some fans and some frozen\nwet wipes out from
  his magical bag to pass around so we could cool ourselves \ndown... you're starting
  to see why I think this bag is magic. </R>\n\nAs we walked, Darren also pointed
  out some other sides of Singapore. We passed\nan electricity substation which had
  a sign on it warning people not to enter.\nIt didn't say it was a substation, it
  had a picture of a soldier aiming a\nrifle at another man with his hands up. Darren
  said that this was better than\nit used to be - ten years ago, the signs were all
  over the place and the\nwithout the gun had been lying on the ground. Apparently
  now they ask\nquestions before shooting ...\n\nAt several points we tried Singaporean
  food: at a Chinese bakery, a\nPeranakan (mixed Chinese & Malay going back 700 years)
  sweet cafe and at\nanother hawker court. The Peranakan sweets (kueh) were delicious
  - mixtures of\ngelatinous rice with various fruit flavours and creams and some pastry.
  I got\nto taste durian, which was pretty good, but I don't think it was strongly\nflavoured.
  The hawker food was also good - Hainan chicken rice (what it sounds\nlike), popiah
  (the best spring rolls we've had so far - a variety of veg with\na slightly sweet
  sauce and crunchy partly-ground peanuts), and carrot cake.\nCarrot cake is a misnomer
  - apparently the word for \\\"carrot\\\" and \\\"white\nradish\\\" are very similar
  in Chinese, but I've no idea why it's called cake.\nIt's ground radish and rice,
  made into balls, then fried. The \\\"black\\\" version,\nwhich we had, is also cooked
  in soy sauce. It's a slightly odd, soft texture,\nbut good. I probably won't be
  making it any time soon (unlike the popiahs). <R>\nWe also learned that at hawker
  centers in singapore, if you place a small, cheap\nitem on the table, it is considered
  reserved and no one else will sit there. \nCue Darren and his magical bag which
  held several of such items. </R>\n\nWe ended at a government housing block, where
  we learnt that 81% of people\nhere live in government housing. We're not exactly
  sure what he meant by\n\\\"government housing\\\", but probably government **built**
  housing, as it can\nbe sold after 5 years. The government owns the building after
  the 99 year\nlease comes to term. The housing seems pretty good - according to Darren,
  the\nprivate equivalent is the same standard except with a swimming pool, a balcony\nand
  a security guard you don't need. The government flats we saw were around\n1 million
  US dollars while the private ones were another 700,000.\n\nThe government flats
  also drew our attention to some of the interesting\napproaches of the Singapore
  government. They use social engineering quite a\nbit (but not in the cyber-security
  sense). Darren described it as trying to\ncreate the ideal society, but using pragmatic
  approaches rather than waiting\nfor ideal solutions. For example, some time after
  the subway was introduced,\npeople kept leaving chewing gum on the doors, causing
  them to jam, preventing\nthe train from moving and screwing up the entire system.
  The government\nreaction was to ban the sale and purchase of chewing gum, which
  remains to\nthis day. Another example is that to prevent hippy culture, in the sixties\nforeign
  men with long hair had to cut it before entering the country and local\nmen with
  long hair were served last at all government offices. Finally, a more\nserious example
  is that in order to buy a government flat, you need to be\nmarried or have proof
  that you will marry soon. The government believes that\nthe nuclear (heterosexual)
  family is the building block and uses this method\nto encourage that.\n\nAlso interesting
  was some of the personal financial policy. For an average\nsalary (very roughly
  S$5000/$3750/£2500 per month), the income tax rate is\nonly 3.5%. However, 20% is
  put into a compulsory savings account, with another\n17% added by your employer.
  This can only be spent on:\n* your own (or immediate family's) healthcare\n* property\n*
  your children's education\n* your pension\n\nHealthcare is not free and there is
  no welfare state, and while there are\nprovisions for those with low incomes, it
  is possible to fall through the\ncracks in the system and be dependent on charity
  funds.\n\nAnyway, we went up to the 50th floor of one of seven government housing
  blocks\nwhich were linked by a roof terrace at that level. They're also linked by
  an\n800m running track surrounding them 24 floors below. The view was amazing,\njust
  on the outskirts of downtown, near many of the skyscrapers. Recent\nplanning policy
  has made it compulsory for all new buildings to have **at\nleast 100%** of the area
  of the footprint of the building as horizontal green\nspace within the building.
  This means many of the buildings are very green,\nwith garden levels and rooftop
  parks - even some with plants growing up the\nheight of the building on the outer
  walls. \n\nWe ended our tour and made our way to two light shows, both of which
  were\nfree. The first was in the Gardens by the Bay, a pretty recently developed\npublic
  garden space built (like everywhere else) on reclaimed land. The light\nshow is
  in the supertree grove (shown on Planet Earth 2). The supertrees are\nmassive pink
  metal structures reminiscent of branching trees with plants\ngrowing up around the
  struts. They are impressive and would be imposing if it\nwasn't for the nearby skyscrapers.
  <R> It is pretty cool but there is a lot of \nconcrete around for something that
  is a garden, it could do with a bit more \ngreen. </R>\n\nWe lay on the ground with
  the crowds in the centre of the grove and watched\nthe trees light up to a variety
  of Disney soundtracks culminating with Star\nWars. It was somewhat bizarre, but
  so is the rest of the place. We had dinner\nin the gardens' own hawker court, Satay
  by the Bay. Rosie enjoyed the satay\nwhile I went for another Indian bread, murtabak
  - a stuffed pancake, in this\ncase with mutton.\n\nWe then left the park, walking
  alonside the water to the hulking Marina Bay\nSands hotel - three huge, curved tower
  blocks supporting a slightly bent\nplatform almost like a ship above them. It also
  has a light show set within\nthe bay, this time made primarily from water jets.
  It also creates moving\npictures from lights shone through sprayed mist. At points,
  the jets looked\nlike lava and the music was overwhelmingly loud. The hard rock
  was somewhat\nover the top and didn't quite go with the gentle singing. Pretty odd.
  <R> It \nwas very very intense, espcially after the twinkly lights and disney music
  of \nthe super trees. </R>\n"

  We both woke up a little sick this morning. I'd had a bit of a sniffle and a
  sore throat for a day or two, probably caught from Tom on the trek, but it
  wasn't anything serious.

  We shared a really good breakfast at a bakery in the centre of the city. We
  wrote the rest of our postcards and feedback forms for our trek. We made our
  way to the Llama Path office to drop off our forms and our bags, then
  continued further out from the centre to book our bus out of Cusco for a few
  days' time.

  We walked back up the large, smoggy road to the centre, stopping in a market
  to browse souvenirs and ended up geting an alpaca blanket. On the way up the
  road we had some decent street food - an avocado sandwich, a cinnamon roll
  and a soy-flavoured steak sandwich.

  Our activity for the day was a chocolate making class in a Choco Museo (really
  more of a shop). It was just the two of us in the class and it was great fun.
  We roasted, peeled and ground our own cacoa beans, then had several drinks
  made from them: chocolate tea made from the cacoa skins and honey, Mayan hot
  chocolate from the bean paste mixed in hot water with chilli and honey, and
  early European hot chocolate by mixing the bean paste with milk, cloves, sugar
  and cinnamon sticks. The last hot chocolate was surprisingly good.

  We then tasted a range of chocolates: milk, dark and white. We then tasted
  five separate chocolates each made from a different cacoa from a different
  region. All were 70% apart from the one from Cusco, which was 85%. Rosie and I
  preferred different cacoas, but both agreed that the San Martin was the worst
  (apparently the only one that Peru exports).

  The high point of the class was making our own chocolates. Our instructor,
  Martin, opened a drawer which contained two slow cookers - one full of melted
  dark chocolate and the other full of melted milk chocolate. We both opted for
  dark (because their dark chocolate is incredible) and selected a sheet of
  moulds, then filled them with some flavourings (salt, nuts, chilli, quinoa)
  and topped them up with melted chocolate.

  We left our chocolates to set in the shop, then went back to the hotel for a
  bit (more diary writing ... got a few days to catch up on). We collected our
  chocolate before dinner, then went to an Indian restaurant which wasn't quite
  as good as the reviews said it was. However, the free tortilla chips with
  chilli sauce and raita was a great appetiser (probably something to do with
  the Mexican sister restaurant next door).

  We took advantage of our hotel TV again that night and watched the second half
  of the Incredibles. It was in Spanish, but we know it well enough to wokr out
  what was being said.

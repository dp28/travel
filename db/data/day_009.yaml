  Today was a bit more chilled out it more ways than one. Primarily we didn't have
  anything booked, but in addition the temperature had dropped to about 18Â°C.

  We spent the morning wandering through Chiang Mai with the aim of booking
  tomorrow's activities, our onwards transport, and most importantly, scoping out
  afternoon tea. Several of the more expensive hotels ($300 a night rather than
  our $20 a night place) offer afternoon tea, complete with an "artistic tower of
  sweet and savoury temptations". We ended up at 2pm on the riverside balcony of
  the Anantara hotel with tea, scones, about fifteen different snacks and a
  milkshake each. Admittedly, the milkshake probably works a lot better at the
  more normal temperatures of 25-35 degrees. <R> Afternoon tea was amazing and
  is something I've always wanted to do! </R>

  We were woken up at 6am this time, again with coca tea. We were quite a bit
  lower than last night so it had been warmer - quite a few of the group had had
  trouble sleeping the night before, but were better off last night. I woke up
  with a bit of a sore throat, but luckily Rosie's knee was a bit better (it
  hadn't been great towards the end of our long downhill yesterday).

  Today's walk was almost entirely a gradual downhill path. Soon after leaving
  we came across one of the many paid toilets (one sol), but this one was
  actually good. So far it's been almost a rule that the more you pay for a
  toilet, the worse it is. Surprisingly, this one had a toilet seat, toilet
  paper, soap and was clean, none of which are expected. Everyone was happy,
  especially after the previous campsites facilities (a ceramic hole in the
  ground). Apologies for the details of this paragraph, but after a few days
  walking and with limited access, these things become pretty important.

  The views on the walk were good and the group was really fun, so we both ended
  up in different places within he group throughout the day and chatted quite a
  bit. We saw plenty of large butterflies and even a small snakeskin on the
  path.

  We finished our walking for the day at La Playa (no, it's not a beach) and had
  lunch. Everyone was impressed at the animals made out of fruit that adorned
  our main course platters - they were very impressive. After eating we played
  a large game of President with eight people - things change around pretty
  quickly, even with two decks.

  For most of us, the afternoon's activity was to visit the nearby hot springs.
  "Nearby" meant an hour down the windy gravel road to the base of the valley
  in a minibus. The driver had a long playlist of songs from the 1990s and
  2000s, meaning from most of our childhoods and teenage years. Pretty quickly
  we were all singing along to most of them, taking our minds off the steep
  drop to our side.

  We whiled away a couple of hours in the hottest of the pools at the hot
  springs, glorious after a couple of days of walking without showers. There was
  one pool even hotter about the size of a bathtub that was even hotter which
  we all tried - you could see the warm water trickling out of the rocks.

  On the way back up we had more of a singalong (except to a couple of the
  out of place explicit rap songs). We had another decent dinner with a very
  impressive chocolate cake to finish. We didn't quite finish it, but it did go
  very well with some milo sauce on it.

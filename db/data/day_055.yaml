  We left Semporna early this morning, which I was fairly happy about, to be
  honest. We had another decent breakfast of roti (the Indian food here is
  pretty great), then hopped on the four hour bus to Sandakan. Six hours later
  we arrived.

  Or at least, we were told to leave the bus. The "long distance" bus station is
  4.5km from the centre of the town. It's a weird place - apparently a new town
  centre is being built 4.5km from the existing one beside the sea, so it's
  oddly spread out. The current centre is reasonably compact, pressed between
  the sea and steep hills, so has quite a few high-rise buildings. It's not
  quite as dirty as Semporna (although there's still quite a bit of plastic in
  the water).

  Our hostel is more of our normal fare and much nicer than Semporna, too. It's
  very central, so we had a decent lunch and spent the afternoon doing laundry
  at a laundrette (to avoid the extortionate price in our hostel - $3 per kg!).

  We walked up some poorly-lit steps up a hill overlooking the centre to an
  English restaurant (one of the recommended places here). I can't remember
  ever seeing a chicken and pineapple salad on a menu in the UK, but it was
  decent.

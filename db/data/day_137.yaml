  We returned to the same place for breakfast, but today we each ordered
  something. The pancake I got was **huge**, so we didn't end up having lunch...

  There was some sort of soldiers' day or graduation ceremony or some
  combination of the two happening in the Plaza de Armas. We made our way
  through the crowds, ending up buying a couple of souvenirs.

  We walked up one of the hills behind the city to the ruin of an Incan fort.
  It's called Sacsayhuaman, or something like that - wikipedia lists eleven
  separate spellings, all pronounced "sexy woman". The stonework is very
  impressive, with some of the pieces of granite estimated to weigh between 120
  and 200 tonnes, sculpted to fit perfectly with the other stones.

  Rosie had been here before and remembered that some of the stones near the
  fort could be used as a slide, so we got a few videos of that, too. We had a
  look at the view and walked around the site, then slowly made our way down.

  After some diary and photos, we checked out a few different restaurants,
  ending up at somewhere near where we'd been before with (shock) blended
  pisco sours but really good chocolate lava cake.

  Back at the hotel, Peruvian TV hadn't improved but our wifi had so were able
  to watch a quikck movie before sleep.

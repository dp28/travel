  Today was our last full day in South East Asia - it's gone really quickly.
  It's possibly been one of our more expensive daystoo as we decided to splurge
  a bit on our last day.

  We had booked to do three dives today with the same dive centre as before (you
  get a discount for doing five). We also decided to bring the GoPro along, so
  unlike two days ago there should be some evidence that we went, too. I had the
  camera for the first and last dive while Rosie had it for the middle one.

  Our first dive was just after 9am at "Shark Point". We did see a couple of
  white-tipped reef sharks swimming about in a small cave, but not any more than
  that. We did see plenty of turtles, however. There was quite a strong current
  for the entire dive, which made maneuvering more difficult even though we
  mainly just let ourselves drift with it. It was also a bit disorienting that
  towards the end we ended up in a current going almost the opposite direction.

  We had the same guide for all three dives who I think had only recently
  qualified as a divemaster or was just about to finish qualifying. She was ok,
  but had a habit of aking us a bit too deep - we went to a bit below 20 metres
  on every dive, despite the fact that, strictly speaking, we're only qualified
  to 18 metres. 20 metres is probably ok, but on our last dive she went to 27
  and we probably went to 24 ... We're fine, though, so no real problems, and we
  have a good thirty hours until we're flying.

  The other two dives, before and after lunch, were good fun - slightly less
  current and along walls of coral. We saw some tiny nudibranch and damselfish
  as well as really big turtles, a stingray, a peacock mantis shrimp,
  scorpionfish, quite a few types of eels, lionfish, remora cleaning turtles ...
  I think I got a few good shots of Moorish Idols, which we've seen everywhere
  but I really like (Gill from Finding Nemo).

  Since arriving on Gili Meno we'd planned to have our last dinner at a
  reasonably fancy and slighly more expensive place on the western side of the
  island we'd walked past on the first day. Unfortunately, the sunset wasn't
  quite as good as that first evening and it was a little windy, but we got a
  well-lit, comfortable table on the beach at the edge of the water. We had a
  fantastic meal which rounded out our time in South East Asia pretty well -
  spring rolls, a chickpea curry and naan for me and chicken satay with fried
  rice for Rosie. All have been common foods during parts of our trip and they
  were all done well. We had some decent drinks and an interesting baked nutella
  cheesecake. We spent the meal coming up with our best and worst points in
  various categories - food so far, accomodation, animals, activities ...

  All in all, a good end to a great (half of a) trip.

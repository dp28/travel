  The combination of only partial walls in our room, nearby people's fondness for techno music and
  a persistent car alarm meant that we lay in until about 9am. I had a massive banana pancake with a
  generous helping of Nutella before heading off towards the main own of Kampot.

  We're staying across the river from the centre, so crossed back across the railway bridge. The
  bridge itself does have a footpath across it as well as rails, but we needed to walk along a few
  hundred metres of train track before and after. There were plenty of people doing the same thing, we
  even saw a few motorbikes by the tracks the previous day. We learnt later in the day that there are
  trains but rarely and fairly slow moving.

  We wandered about Kampot, seeing the river and some of the odder Roundabout statues (eg, a giant
  durian <R> bizarre </R>). We found a bookshop / cafe, which bought some of our finished books off of us.
  We had pineapple pie and kiwi ice cream (the ice cream was better) at one of several "Kampot Pie & Ice
  Cream Palaces" and listened to expats grumble. There seem to be a lot around. Most of the places
  we've been so far have been filled with travelers around our own age, but Kampot (particularly our
  accommodation) seems to have a lot of older single men living here long term.

  We rented a kayak from our guest house, paddling up the river a bit, looking at birds and trying
  (with little success) to pass an under-ripe mango between our paddles. After a cold shower, I tried
  to catch up with this diary, then had a delicious dinner at a Lebanese restaurant. I know we're in
  Cambodia, but it was highly rated, it's still exploring different tastes, and they both have some
  French influence. Plus I got a banana & Nutella shake later (which definitely counts as Cambodian
  fusion cuisine).

  I finally caught up with the diary after dinner. It takes a surprisingly large amount of time and I
  was 5 days behind ...

  We went to a local bakery for breakfast his morning. I had a "lengua de
  suegra" (mother in law's tongue), which is a long, thin pastry made from many
  thin layers with a central layer of dulce de leche. Honestly, it was a bit of
  a sugar overload. In other bakeries I've seen since they tend to be a lot
  thinner.

  We posted some postcards after breakfast, then Rosie had another cup of tea
  (the bakery hadn't had great tea). We spent the remainder of the morning
  exploring the Qorikancha - a Spanish church and monastery built on the ruins
  of the most important Incan religious building. Supposedly, at the height of
  the Incan empire, the interior walls had been covered in plates of gold, only
  to be looted by the Spanish. The building itself is odd, a mix of the
  distinctive Incan masonry, later Spanish stonework and Christian imagery.

  We rested for a while on a bench outside as neither of us are quite over our
  colds. We found some lunch not too far away - Peruvian sushi, which was
  surprisingly good: rolls of rice, fried trout and avocado covered in some
  delicious sauce.

  In the afternoon we had booked a cooking course. It started with a tour of San
  Pedro market for about 45 minutes, tasting three different types of
  passionfruit and two different chocolates. Our chef bought some ingredients
  and led our group of eight to his kitchen.

  The group was hard work. The class made me extra thankful that we'd had a
  such a great group for our Salkantay trek. No one in our group oday was
  particularly enthusiastic (including us, but we're claiming sickness). Some
  members of the group seemed shocked at the sugar, butter and cream that were
  in the recipes, despite the fact they'd signed up to make pisco sours, quinoa
  risotto and a creamy pudding ...

  I felt sorry for the chef, but the food was good. We made pisco sours with a
  local passionfruit rather than lemon or lime and I think it did improve the
  drink. We then made three ceviches - a traditional one, another flavoured with
  a different passionfruit, and one with Japanese influence - soy & oyster
  sauces with sesame oil. All were decent, but Japanese one was a particularly
  good blend of flavours. These were followed by two heavier courses: a potato
  cake (Andean potato and rehydrated dehydrated potato) in a huancaina sauce
  (a creamy yellow pepper sauce with some crackers blended into it), then an
  even creamier quinoa risotto. The dessert was a simple mix of whipped cream
  with sweet cucumber (similar to cantaloupe melon) and chirimoya (a **very**
  sweet fruit).

  We didn't need any dinner after that, but had some drinks at a restaurant on
  the way home - another pisco sour and a traditional sweet corn drink, chicha
  morada.

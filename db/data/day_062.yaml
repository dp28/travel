:entry: "The plan for the day was a long walk around a circuit in the forst with a
  stop\noff at a hide. We started a little later than originally planned so that we\ncould
  get a bit more sleep - the fan in the room, while necessary, was pretty\nloud. We
  had a quick breakfast and bought plenty of water and a snack lunch -\ncrisps and
  popcorn, the only somewhat decent looking transportable food. <R> \nDon't worry
  mum, we had vegtables for dinner. </R>\n\nWe got the boat across, then started along
  the boardwalk into the forest at\nabout 10am. It was swelteringly hot and we'd been
  sweating since leaving our\nguest house, <R> since before leaving the guest house
  if we're being honest. </R> \nThe signs said it was 9.5km to the hide we were aiming
  for, about\nhalf way along our circuit. We saw plenty of butterflies and heard beetles,\nfrogs,
  lizards and birds, but saw only one or two people an hour. We left the\nboardwalk
  after about half an hour, continuing beside the river deeper into\nthe forest, passing
  small streams and seeing our first few leeches. <R> I must\nhave seen over 100 leeches
  throughout the walk, and this was the dry season, I can't \neven imagine how many
  there must be during the wet season. Also despite being \ndisgusting, they're really
  funny looking creatures on the ground. </R>\n\nTwo hours into the walk, a sign said
  we were 5.5km from the hide. We knew we\nwere going a bit slower than normal, but
  2km per hour seemed very slow. The\ndistance also didn't match up with Maps.Me,
  or even the other signs - it said\nit was 5km back to the village, so something
  was up. We continued anyway.\n\nWe passed a couple with a guide (with a huge rucksack)
  heading to the same\nhide, but with the intention of sleeping there. The guide seemed
  surprised we\nwere going for a day trip, and more so that we weren't coming back
  the same\nway.\n\nWe walked on, seeing huge buttress-rooted trees, insects, small
  streams,\nfallen trees and the leavings of some large animal (elephants?). By half
  past\none, we were sweaty, hungry, tired and still 2.5km from the hide by Maps.Me's\nbuest
  guess (our more reliable distance info source). We decided to turn\naround, find
  somewhere to have lunch, then head back to town.\n\nOur walk back was, unsurprisingly,
  pretty similar to the way out. We passed\nmost of the same people and remained very,
  very sweaty. We saw stunning trees,\nferns and tiny flowers. Towards the end of
  our walk, we happened upon a pair\nof wild pigs, just off to the side of the path.\n\nTired
  but happy, we finished at the resort. We treated ourselves to some more\nexpensive
  drinks (banana shake for me, a guinness and a 100 plus for Rosie),\nand enjoyed
  not walking for a while. After our rest, we headed back to the\nguest house for
  a much-needed shower.\n\nIn the evening, we booked onto a night safari with the
  same tour operator as\nthe day before, Han Travel. Along with two other couples,
  we got in the back\nof a 4x4 pickup truck which spent an hour driving through a
  palm plantation\nbeside the rainforest. A guy on the roof of the truck used a strong
  torch to\nsearch for animals and direct the driver. We spotted two small cat (probably\nleopard
  cats), a couple of owls, and, on the road back, several wild pigs. For\nme, it was
  worth it just to see the difference between plantation and forest.\nThe plantation
  had presumably been harvested or created recently - there were\nonly some small
  palms around, mostly just churned earth and clay. It was a\nstark difference to
  the lush life on the other side of the fence.\n"

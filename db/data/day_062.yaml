  The plan for the day was a long walk around a circuit in the forst with a stop
  off at a hide. We started a little later than originally planned so that we
  could get a bit more sleep - the fan in the room, while necessary, was pretty
  loud. We had a quick breakfast and bought plenty of water and a snack lunch -
  crisps and popcorn, the only somewhat decent looking transportable food.

  We got the boat across, then started along the boardwalk into the forest at
  about 10am. It was swelteringly hot and we'd been sweating since leaving our
  guest house.The signs said it was 9.5km to the hide we were aiming for, about
  half way along our circuit. We saw plenty of butterflies and heard beetles,
  frogs, lizards and birds, but saw only one or two people an hour. We left the
  boardwalk after about half an hour, continuing beside the river deeper into
  the forest, passing small streams and seeing our first few leeches.

  Two hours into the walk, a sign said we were 5.5km from the hide. We knew we
  were going a bit slower than normal, but 2km per hour seemed very slow. The
  distance also didn't match up with Maps.Me, or even the other signs - it said
  it was 5km back to the village, so something was up. We continued anyway.

  We passed a couple with a guide (with a huge rucksack) heading to the same
  hide, but with the intention of sleeping there. The guide seemed surprised we
  were going for a day trip, and more so that we weren't coming back the same
  way.

  We walked on, seeing huge buttress-rooted trees, insects, small streams,
  fallen trees and the leavings of some large animal (elephants?). By half past
  one, we were sweaty, hungry, tired and still 2.5km from the hide by Maps.Me's
  buest guess (our more reliable distance info source). We decided to turn
  around, find somewhere to have lunch, then head back to town.

  Our walk back was, unsurprisingly, pretty similar to the way out. We passed
  most of the same people and remained very, very sweaty. We saw stunning trees,
  ferns and tiny flowers. Towards the end of our walk, we happened upon a pair
  of wild pigs, just off to the side of the path.

  Tired but happy, we finished at the resort. We treated ourselves to some more
  expensive drinks (banana shake for me, a guinness and a 100 plus for Rosie),
  and enjoyed not walking for a while. After our rest, we headed back to the
  guest house for a much-needed shower.

  In the evening, we booked onto a night safari with the same tour operator as
  the day before, Han Travel. Along with two other couples, we got in the back
  of a 4x4 pickup truck which spent an hour driving through a palm plantation
  beside the rainforest. A guy on the roof of the truck used a strong torch to
  search for animals and direct the driver. We spotted two small cat (probably
  leopard cats), a couple of owls, and, on the road back, several wild pigs. For
  me, it was worth it just to see the difference between plantation and forest.
  The plantation had presumably been harvested or created recently - there were
  only some small palms around, mostly just churned earth and clay. It was a
  stark difference to the lush life on the other side of the fence.

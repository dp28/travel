  After only a couple of nights in Georgetown, we were off again, this time to the
  Cameron Highlands. Famous for its tea production, this was one of the places
  Rosie had been looking forward to in particular. <R> Tea is the best!!</R>
  It was another long bus journey, starting out over one of the huge bridges to the
  mainland. Highlight of the morning: at our ten minute mid-trip stop, the cafe in
  the station served fresh rotiboys (the delicious butter-filled rolls we found in
  Vietnam). Low point: due to a leak, my small bag was soaked, including my computer
  (it was fine after drying for a day or two).

  After checking in to our hotel (with an even smaller box room than the previous
  place), we went in search of tea. Or rather, Rosie did, and I tagged along for
  some food. In addition to tea, the Cameron Highlands produce a lot of fruit and
  veg, particularly strawberries. Therefore, tea, scones and strawberry jam are
  available from a lot of places. We had tea and scones (and a lassi for me), but
  unfortunately none were quite as good as we were hoping. <R> Unfortunately the
  scones were just a little bit stale, although they were warm, and the tea tasted
  only slightly better than Tesco own brand tea. </R>

  With a little bit of the day left, we had a short walk to a nearby waterfall.
  There are plenty of signposted walking trails around Tanah Rata (the main town),
  so it was easy enough to find a short walk. We turned around pretty early
  because it was supposed to bucket down.

  For dinner, we ended up getting curry in a bread bowl. A large proportion of
  the local population are of southern Indian descent, originally brought by the
  British as labourers for the plantations. Because of this, there is a plethora
  of decent Indian food, which we had quite a bit of.

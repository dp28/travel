  Somewhat like the day before, according to most weather forecasts it was supposed to rain quite a
  bit, but didn't. We took advantage of this in the morning by renting a stand up paddle board and
  paddling out to (& around) a small island nearby. It wasn't exactly an island - the water between
  the shore and the island wasn't deep enough to paddle through, so we had to get off for a while. At
  low tide it may be dry land, not that there's much tidal variation.

  On the way back we were able to see plenty of lethal-looking, spiky sea urchins and fish, including
  little shoals that would repeatedly jump out of the water. We then went for a swim in the still,
  clear water. The threatened rain never materialised - much to Rosie's disappointment. She was
  looking forward to being in the water while it poured down on us.

  We spent the afternoon reading & programming again - I managed to get the site to the point that it
  could display basic posts and load in all of the ones I had written so far. We then walked back to
  close to where we'd been for dinner the previous day to a Swiss restaurant we'd booked for dinner.

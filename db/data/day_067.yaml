  Our time in Singapore was brief - this was our second and last full day there.
  We went for a traditional breakfast of kaya toast, which was surprisingly
  good. Kaya is a jam made from coconut, egg and sugar and better than it
  sounds. It's spread on toast with a huge chunk of butter (maybe half the width
  and thickness of the toast), then dipped into partially-boiled eggs.

  We then had our own walking tour, based off our own reseach and some
  recommendations from Rosie's friend from St Andrews, Laura, who'd lived here
  for a while. We started at the Buddha's tooth temple, which, unsurprisingly,
  housed a tooth believed to have been from the Buddha (surrounded by gold).

  We spent most of the rest of the day in and around the Gardens by the Bay.
  There were loads of signs around saying what to do if you encountered an
  otter, so we hoped to spot one, but failed to.  <R> Sad </R> We walked through the gardens
  in the heat and up to a large water reserve with a good view of the skyline
  and plenty of locals flying impressive kites. We then made our way to the paid
  parts of the gardens - two huge glass domes.

  The first was the cloud forest, a huge structure with plants from many cloud
  forests around the world at different levels. It had a lift to the top, then
  a walkway down, around and through the structure. It also, kind of
  ludicrously, claims to have the world's highest indoor waterfall.

  It was crowded, but impressive. Just after we arrived, lots of small hoses
  started letting out streams of mist all over the place. There were plenty of
  strange plants, including the carniverous ones. The carniverous pitcher plants
  and venus fly traps were right at the top, interspersed with larger Lego
  reconstructions of the plants themselves. <R> There was
  also a beautiful collection of many many orchids and a some what sobering
  video and exhibit on climate change and the effect of humanity on nature. I
  really hope that the many locals watching the video saw and were moved by it,
  the level of single use plastic in SEA is rediculous. I can't even count how
  many times I've told someone I do not need a plastic bag. </R>

  We then went to the flower dome - a bit smaller and currently focusing on
  mediterannean climates. There were cool baobab trees and several plants we
  recognised from our gardens at home, especially as one of the four regions
  being shown was California. Unfortunately, the display was in the process of
  being changed, so some plants (mainly the cherry trees) were not in flower.

  We went back to Satay by the Bay to verify that popiah were just as good there
  as in the other hawker court (they were). We then went to a rooftop bar called
  Level 33 (guess what floor it's on ...) with a view of the bay and the light
  shows. The drink prices were exorbitant, but it felt like we might as well go
  for a Singapore sling while we're here. The sneaky bar didn't include the
  10% service charge or 7% GST in their menu prices. However, the view, once we
  got a table by the edge, was great.

  The only real downpoint was losing a bit of money on the subway. There's a
  prepaid card you can buy for $5 which significantly reduces the price of
  tickets, but only lets you travel if it has over about $2.50 on it. That means
  it costs about $7.50, which is worth it for about 10 or more journeys, but not
  quite for our 5. Ah well, we'll be more skeptical in the future. <R> However
  when you consider the amount of money we lost on the subway tickets compared
  with what we spent on the drinks it is really a very small amount. </R>

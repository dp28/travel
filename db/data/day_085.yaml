  Despite a lie in until 9.30am, we were both a bit groggy, probably due to Bali
  being three hours behind Sydney. We had our toast (or toasted banana and Dairy
  Milk sandwich), then caught a bus to Coogee, a beach in the south of Sydney.
  We met Marianne and spent the early afternoon walking up the coast past
  various beaches and coves, ending at Bondi beach. We stopped part way through
  for milkshakes and iced tea, or rather, tea with ice because they didn't do
  iced tea ... <R> It was hot outside and I wanted iced tea which they didn't make but 
  they happily brought me a pot of tea and a cup of ice. Everyone was cool with 
  it, but Daniel and Marianne made fun of me for the next 3 days. It was just 
  iced tea. </R>

  Coming from the UK, Australia seems very similar, but with just a few
  differences that occasionally catch me out. It's almost like the US, but
  without quite as many differences. As we walked past all the little beaches it
  was very reminiscent of Southern California, especially with all the free
  water fountains in the parks.

  Another similarity was the food. We'd looked up Australian food and found that
  a lot of "Australian" food seems to be from other places, maybe with a new
  name (sausages are "snags", a mille feuille is a "vanilla slice", spag bol is
  the same and all are quintessentially Australian apparently). We had classic
  Australian beach food - fish and chips, complete with mushy peas. The chippy
  even sold deep fried Mars Bars and haggis. <R> They are also trying to claim 
  the sausage roll which is just not on. </R>

  Very full of greasy food, we got the bus further north to Watson's Bay, right
  at the sourthern mouth of the harbour. We had a brief sceneic walk above the
  cliffs before checking the ferry schedule, only to find we'd missed the last
  ferry. We got another bus to the next ferry stop that still had ferries
  running to catch one to the centre.

  Like London's Oyster card system, you can get prepaid Opal cards here to pay
  for trains, buses and ferries. Unfortunately, unlike London (as far as I
  know), contactless cards can only be used directly on ferries and have higher
  fares. Anyway, we used our Opal cards quite a bit, so between daily fare caps
  and weekly discounts we ended up with quite a few cheap journeys (but did
  spend quite a lot overall).

  The ferry from Rose Bay to Circle Quay was great - we got a decent view of the
  Harbour Bridge and probably the best view of the trip of the Opera House. The
  ferry was large, comfortable and had free wifi. It was slightly delayed as it
  had to maneuvre around the huge cruise ship that was leaving, but we had time.

  We parted ways with Marianne at Circle Quay and searched out one of Sydney's
  chocolate cafes after her recommendation. We found a Lindt cafe geared up for
  Easter, complete with Lindor pick and mix of quite a few weird flavours. I had
  a Lindt chocolate lava cake with white chocolate ice cream, but held back from
  indulging too much. Next time.

  We went back to Circle Quay for sunset and saw the light show projected onto
  part of the Opera House at about 7.30pm. Up close, the Opera House is not as big as I
  expected - a bit smaller than I thought and it's actually hard to get a
  picture that looks like the well known, iconic Sydeny pictures, just because
  that close up you can only get a couple of sections of the building in the
  picture.

  Having had a rich chocolate dessert earlier, I wasn't that hungry, but Rosie
  was. We found an almost-empty restaurant and cocktail bar and shared a
  charcuterie board and a couple of drinks. We got the train back to Redfern
  afterwards and walked back to our Airbnb.

  Our last day of trekking was pretty short. We gotup at 6.30am and walked
  downhill out of our valley for three and a half hours. The terrain was rocky
  and occasionally steep. Rosie had hurt her knee at the end of the walk
  yesterday, so was a bit slower than normal, while the American guys were
  obviously feeling better, so were faster. We followed a river down, with great
  views as the river got wider and stronger.

  We got a minibus back to Huaraz (three hours rather than the five it took to
  get to the start of the trek). The first half of the trip was down steep
  switchbacks on a gravel road with a massive drop on one side.

  Back in Huaraz, we had a huge lunch at the house of the owner of the company,
  Orlando. We were then dropped off at our various hotels and said goodbye to
  the others. The shower in our hotel was very, very welcome.

  We had dinner with Michelle and Mike, the English couple from the trek, at the
  first Italian restaurant we'd been to in Huaraz. We were all pretty tired, so
  once we got back to the hotel went immediately to sleep, happy that we didn't
  have to get up until 9pm.

  We have quite a bit of time in Arequipa, so today was a slow day. We spent the
  morning dealing with the site - adding photos, writing diary entries and
  programming (adding info about the food we've eaten).

  We left the hostel at lunch, getting some more fruit shakes from the local
  market and a couple of empanadas for lunch. We sat for a while in the central
  square (they always seem to be "Plaza del Armas"), then had a look around a
  colonial house's courtyards and posted some postcards.

  We spent around an hour at one of the main museums, which focuses on a "mummy"
  of a 12-14 year old girl ("Juanita") discovered on a volcano near Arequipa and
  believed to be a 500 year old Incan human sacrifice. There was a twenty minute
  video, then a guided tour culminating in seeing Juanita's frozen corpse. She's
  not actually a mummy, but a frozen corpse due to being sacrificed at above
  6,000m. Her face was exposed, so has dried out, but apparently still has
  muscle, all organs and frozen blood inside. The fact that the Incans could
  make it up to that altitude with all the kit to for a sacrificial ceremony is
  pretty impressive, even if it is pretty macabre.

  We returned to the main square and had a pisco sours on one of the balcony
  restaurants overlooking the plaza, then returned to our hostel to get warmer
  jackets. On the way we heard the dulcet tones of "Under the sea" from Disney's
  The Little Mermaid blasted from a bin lorry. Over the course of the day, we
  heard this maybe six times from presumably the same lorry, from midday until
  after dinner. It was pretty baffling - why were they playing that song? Why
  the same song over and over? Why did they take the entire day just to collect
  rubbish in a two-block radius of the Plaza del Armas? Weird.

  We had dinner at a slightly fancier restaurant with a (deserved) reputation
  for large portions (I had a starter which was an entire stuffed pepper and a
  slab of potato gratin). The food was excellent and I just had enough room for
  pudding. I'm a sucker for dessert tasting platters and all four of the
  desserts served in jam jars were interesting and tasty (although I'm still
  yet to find a lemon meringue pie here with any bite).Â

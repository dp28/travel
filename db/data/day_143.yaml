  After long bus journeys we tend to sleep well, but not last night. Huaraz
  seems obe an incredibly loud place - dogs, car horns, and yet-to-be-explained
  explosions somewhere between fireworks and cannon fire. Just to ensure that
  the place never falls silent, some people up the road from us had taken it
  upon themselves to play a lot of music very loudly until at least 3.30am.
  Admittedly, it may have been some kind of local celebration, but I have no
  idea. I mainly just noticed that it set off at least one car alarm which
  seemed to just be incorporated into the din.

  We lay in until about 9.30am (it was blessedly quiet), then got up for
  probably our last planning day of our trip. We booked a day toour for tomorrow
  and the four-day Santa Cruz trek starting the day after. Rosie booked the
  remainder of our accommodation and (hopefully) made sure that the sleeping bag
  she'll get for our trek will be warm enough. We had a pretty big lunch at an
  Indian/Mexican/South East Asian fusion place, so have decided to skip dinner -
  we'll see if that has any effect on our trek tomorrow ...

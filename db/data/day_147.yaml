  Up again at six, our group split into three - the American women had left with
  one guide already, the American guys went with one of the porters (and a
  horse) straight to the next camp while the remaining five of us went with the
  lead guide up to a lake before going to the camp. We all really thought the
  lead guide should go with the two American guys, but he didn't seem to want
  to, nor did he seem particularly good at dealing with their problems ...

  The lake itself was spectacular, similar to laguna 69 but with a glacier
  actually entering it. Unlike laguna 69, there were only ten or so other people
  there. Over the whole four days we probably saw fewer than 100 people overall.
  On the way down from the lake we had a great view of several snow-capped
  peaks, including one that is apparently the mountain depicted in the Paramount
  Pictures logo.

  Most of the rest of the walk was along a flat valley bottom that was almost a
  desert in comparison to the mountainsides. Our guide said it used to be green
  and lush, but an avalanche had uprooted all the vegetation.

  We got to the edge of a lake and our guide, Cesar, stopped us for lunch. Or
  rather, where lunch should have been. It was carried by the porter with the
  American guys, but they were no longer there. He told us something had
  probably gone wrong, so we had to walk to the camp. We all scoffed quite a lot
  of our snacks, loading up on sweets and chocolate to get us through two hours
  of walking.

  Maybe half an hour later, on the other side of the lake, we met the porter who
  still had lunch. One of the guys had been riding the horse, so they'd gone
  faster and were already on the way to camp. We all had some lunch (a delicious
  causa) even though we'd had our fill of sweets, then headed to camp.

  Once we finished for walking we played some more cards while we waited for
  dinner. Due to our overly-large lunch we weren't as reluctant to wait until
  7.30pm as we had been the day before. The promise of hot wine after dinner was
  also welcome.

  There were quite a few domestic animals about, so we went to sleep to the
  sounds of dogs barking, donkeys braying and the occasional moo. I still
  managed to sleep pretty well.

  We were woken up at about 6.30 am by the conductor announcing over the tannoy
  that they needed to change our beds back into seats. We watched the sun rise as
  the train pulled into Chiang Mai station, then packed up and left. <R> Guys they
  had really English Breakfast tea, not just lipton!! </R>

  Chiang Mai is significantly smaller and noticeably cooler (at least in the
  morning) than Bangkok. It still has the moat and some of the walls of the
  original city, which we drove past to our hotel. We dropped off our bags, signed
  up for a trip the next day and headed out to see some temples.

  After Bangkok, we both knew we were pretty close to being templed out. However,
  Chiang Mai has a lot of temples, they're mostly free and don't require booking.
  We slowly wandered around as the day got hotter, admiring the architecture and
  several groups of topiary animals. <R> There was also some cool elephant statues
  at the oldest temple in the city. </R>

  Everything was cheaper in Chiang Mai, too - from the taxi to the food. The city
  clearly depends on tourism and the museum explaining the history of the area was
  very well done. A lot of it focused on the founding of the city, whereas the
  annexation of the former kingdom of Lanna by Siam was stated briefly towards the
  end.

  We rounded off the day by spending quite a bit of time booking our next few
  places to stay and transport between them - unfortunately necessary during a
  long trip. We grabbed dinner at a near by night food market which had some
  great-tasting food. I love banana pancakes, so had to try the "banana roti with
  Milo" - an interpretation of the Indian flatbread roti filled with banana and
  fried, then layered with condensed milk and Milo (a malted chocolate drink
  powder). Definitely something I'll have a go at making!

:entry: "Previously, we had planned at this point to go to Tioman island to go diving\nor
  surfing. However, with a bit more research it proved more tedious and\nunpredictable
  to get there than it was worth for a day or two. Instead, we\noptend to go to Taman
  Negara (Malay for \\\"National Park\\\"), the oldest\nrainforest in the world (130
  million years).\n\nYou can get there either by two buses or a bus and a boat. We
  went for the bus\nand boat, which left from just around the corner from our hostel
  in KL. The\nbus dropped us off at a jetty where we could get lunch and buy permits
  for the\npark. The permits cost $0.25, but the fine for not having one is $2,500.
  \n\nThe boat ride lasted about an hour and a half in a long, thin motor boat with\nabout
  ten of us sat in pairs facing forward. We were sitting at water level\nand the sides
  of the boat didn't extend that high, so we got sprayed quite a\nbit on the way up
  river.\n\nThe small village, Kuala Tahan, seems to be the main base people use to\nexplore
  the park. It's tiny, but filled with guest houses and floating\nrestaurants (pretty
  low down at the moment because the water is so low). We\nspent ten or twenty minutes
  following different sets of instructions to get\nto our guest house - it had two
  names, was shown to be across the river on\nMaps.Me, and was on the other side of
  the village from where we were initially\npointed. Our room was nice enough - it
  had a balcony and a fan, but a squat\ntoilet and was pretty much an oven. <R> The
  fact that we spent 20 minutes \ntrying to find our guest house is really impressive
  when you consider that the \nentire town takes about 20 minutes to walk across.
  Also it was 34 degrees and\nsuper humid, we were very sweaty when we found the guest
  house, a theme that \ncontinued through out our time in Teman Negara. </R>\n\nThe
  park itself was across the river - a one ringgit ($0.25/Â£0.20), one minute\nboat
  trip away. There was a large upmarket resort on that side, apparently\nrecently
  renovated due to the river flooding (despite being about 10 metres\nabove the current
  water level). We walked through the resort to a nature hide\nnearby and spotted
  a wild pig before returning for dinner. The pig was\ndefinitely wild as the town
  is definitely Muslim, so no pork on any menu. We\nalso saw several lizards - one
  only a couple of centimetres long, another\nclose to a metre.\n\nHaving spent most
  of the day sitting, we decided to go on an organised night\nwalk in the park. At
  the start of the walk it looked like we'd made a mistake\n- we were with a fairly
  loud family and the walk was just along the 600m\nboardwalk to the hide we'd been
  to earlier. However, it was great - we saw and\nlearnt a lot even over that difference,
  and, as the family was French, I got\nto brush up on my French listening skills
  (or lack there of). Our guide was\ngreat and had several tricks for seeing insects.
  The best was that with a\ntorch on your head you can see the reflections from spiders'
  eyes very easily.\nThey look like little sparkles and can be harder to spot after
  it has rained\nas they also look like reflections from water droplets. Another trick
  was\nusing a UV torch to search for scorpions. They're black, but have phosphorus\nin
  their shell, so appear bright green in UV.\n\nWe ended up seeing loads of insects
  - in addition to spiders and scorpions, we\nsaw huge millipedes, worker & soldier
  termites, stick insects, a single\nglowworm and a single firefly. At the hide, we
  saw a deer and on the way back\nwe saw a porcupine under one of the buildings of
  the resort. On our way back\nto the guest house we saw (and heard) many large beetles,
  which can make an\nincredible racket <R> all night </R>.\n"

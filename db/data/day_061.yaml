  Previously, we had planned at this point to go to Tioman island to go diving
  or surfing. However, with a bit more research it proved more tedious and
  unpredictable to get there than it was worth for a day or two. Instead, we
  optend to go to Taman Negara (Malay for "National Park"), the oldest
  rainforest in the world (130 million years).

  You can get there either by two buses or a bus and a boat. We went for the bus
  and boat, which left from just around the corner from our hostel in KL. The
  bus dropped us off at a jetty where we could get lunch and buy permits for the
  park. The permits cost $0.25, but the fine for not having one is $2,500.

  The boat ride lasted about an hour and a half in a long, thin motor boat with
  about ten of us sat in pairs facing forward. We were sitting at water level
  and the sides of the boat didn't extend that high, so we got sprayed quite a
  bit on the way up river.

  The small village, Kuala Tahan, seems to be the main base people use to
  explore the park. It's tiny, but filled with guest houses and floating
  restaurants (pretty low down at the moment because the water is so low). We
  spent ten or twenty minutes following different sets of instructions to get
  to our guest house - it had two names, was shown to be across the river on
  Maps.Me, and was on the other side of the village from where we were initially
  pointed. Our room was nice enough - it had a balcony and a fan, but a squat
  toilet and was pretty much an oven. <R> The fact that we spent 20 minutes
  trying to find our guest house is really impressive when you consider that the
  entire town takes about 20 minutes to walk across. Also it was 34 degrees and
  super humid, we were very sweaty when we found the guest house, a theme that
  continued through out our time in Teman Negara. </R>

  The park itself was across the river - a one ringgit ($0.25/Â£0.20), one minute
  boat trip away. There was a large upmarket resort on that side, apparently
  recently renovated due to the river flooding (despite being about 10 metres
  above the current water level). We walked through the resort to a nature hide
  nearby and spotted a wild pig before returning for dinner. The pig was
  definitely wild as the town is definitely Muslim, so no pork on any menu. We
  also saw several lizards - one only a couple of centimetres long, another
  close to a metre.

  Having spent most of the day sitting, we decided to go on an organised night
  walk in the park. At the start of the walk it looked like we'd made a mistake
  - we were with a fairly loud family and the walk was just along the 600m
  boardwalk to the hide we'd been to earlier. However, it was great - we saw and
  learnt a lot even over that difference, and, as the family was French, I got
  to brush up on my French listening skills (or lack there of). Our guide was
  great and had several tricks for seeing insects. The best was that with a
  torch on your head you can see the reflections from spiders' eyes very easily.
  They look like little sparkles and can be harder to spot after it has rained
  as they also look like reflections from water droplets. Another trick was
  using a UV torch to search for scorpions. They're black, but have phosphorus
  in their shell, so appear bright green in UV.

  We ended up seeing loads of insects - in addition to spiders and scorpions, we
  saw huge millipedes, worker & soldier termites, stick insects, a single
  glowworm and a single firefly. At the hide, we saw a deer and on the way back
  we saw a porcupine under one of the buildings of the resort. On our way back
  to the guest house we saw (and heard) many large beetles, which can make an
  incredible racket <R> all night </R>.

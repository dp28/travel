  As well as being St Patrick's Day at home, today happens to be Nyepi, Balinese
  Hindu New Year (and therefore our third new year this year). It is a day of
  meditation with four primary rules:
  * No travel
  * No work
  * No fire
  * No entertainment

  In practice, this means you're not allowed to leave your house and you're not
  supposed to turn on the lights or make much noise. Denise told us that things
  have been getting stricter over the years - originally, kids would maybe play
  quietly in the street, but now there are essentially religious police checking
  you don't leave. The government has turned off the TV for the last few years
  and this year was the first year they disabled the internet. The entire island
  basically shuts down - there's no noise apart from the animals (mainly
  insects, dogs and roosters).

  We'd had a late night, so it seemed like a good day for a lie in. We had a
  late breakfast and started a new book each - I started American Gods as I've
  been meaning to try some Neil Gaiman for a while. We spent most of the morning
  reading and some of the afternoon in Denise's pool.

  We had a great lunch of roasted veg and pizza with Denise, slightly breaking
  the rules (this seems to be ok, as from what I've read, in hotels they allow
  tourists to have light and cooked meals, but put up curtains so that it's not
  disturbing others). We chatted for the late afternoon until the sun went down,
  prompting a quick go at the washing up and gathering of torches (less
  obtrusive than turning on the house lights).

  Once the sun was fully down we were rewarded with a great view of the stars.
  It was pretty clear, partially due to Nyepi effectively leading to an almost
  pollution-free day. We saw plenty of stars, some shooting stars, some
  satellites, a few lightning flashes and a reasonable number of fireflies. We
  only saw one plane as the airport had also been shut.

  We used a little bit of light to go to bed and had a relatively early night.
  It was good to have a day like this on our trip and I'm glad we were able to
  spend it at Denise's and with Denise - it might not have been quite so
  pleasant cooped up in one or two of the box rooms we've ended up in so far.

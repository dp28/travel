  Our reason for coming to Kratie was to see the rare Irrawaddy dolphins. They're
  an endangered species of river dolphin found only in the Mekong, with only 80 to
  90 left. The largest group (about 20) are found near Kratie.

  Down here, the Mekong is pretty massive. It's about 2km wide and must be wider
  at times - apparently the water level rises by up to 15 metres during the rainy
  season.

  We started at a restaurant near our guest house at 7am with six other tourists
  and two guides, then were driven 20km up river and got into our kayaks. They
  weren't sit on tops this time, which was lucky because (a) it was hard work for
  parts, so having something to push my knees against was good, and (b) getting in
  the river was pretty rushed, so I didn't have time to sun cream my legs (my
  lower inner thighs are burnt, however).

  We paddled across the river, then down between lots of small sandy islands
  covered in bushes, all of which must be submerged for months. We stopped on one
  of these to go for a swim (the current was good fun to play in) and have a
  snack. The guides gave us bamboo sticky rice - sticky rice cooked with soya
  beans, coconut milk and a little sugar inside young bamboo. You peel the bamboo
  off, leaving the rice covered in a bamboo paper that is edible.

  While on the island, one of our guides told us of many of the tensions
  surrounding the dolphins and their history. He said that before Pol Pot there
  were around 3,000 of them, but afterwards many people fished the river and had
  relatively easy access to explosives and electrocution equipment. This made
  fishing easier, but killed dolphins, too. Now, there is foreign money invested
  to protect the dolphins, which works, but has its own set of problems. People
  on the west of the river resent that the money is spent on the east, where the
  tourists go. People on the east are wary of corruption eats away some money
  they would otherwise have access to.

  Next, we kayaked through a flooded forest. This was spectacular - large trees
  dotted sparsely through the river, sometimes close enough together to cause the
  water around them to speed up. A large amount of their root systems were
  visible, making the whole place seem overgrown.

  We emerged into a flat expanse with the occasional sand bank and struggled our
  way back to the eastern side against the wind. We got a sense for just how
  strong the wind and currents were. <R> ie. very strong! </R> We saw a few
  local boats with small groups of tourists on them, meaning we had arrived at the dolphin
  pool. Apparently the dolphins prefer deep-water fish in that area of the Mekong, which
  is about 60m deep, rather than the rest, which is mainly 10-15m (at the moment).

  We spent a while paddling up stream, then floating down stream looking out for
  dolphins. We saw quite a few, particularly towards the end. We saw the same pod
  of four or five surface quite a few times, sometimes as close as about ten
  metres. <R> The dolphins were amazing, it's a real privilege to be able to get
  that close to that many of such an endangered population. We probably saw about 20%
  of the total number of Irrawaddy dolphins left in the world. I really hope that
  all the conservation efforts amount to something because these really are beautiful
  creatures. </R>

  We kayaked a bit further down river, then hauled the kayaks up the bank and
  into the truck. We drove back, had a lacklustre lunch, but a decent dinner.
  In between, we updated the site (taking advantage of reliable internet) and
  watched the sunset.

  The main other attraction for us in Sucre was the Cretaceous Park. We met up
  with Wilson and Sita and shared a taxi up to it (another cheap journey).

  The park was (and still is) a quarry for a cement factory. Some time ago they
  stopped excavating one wall due to the increased amount of magnesium in the
  limestone. Underneath that layer, hundreds of dinosaur footprints were found
  - supposedly the largest palaelogical site in the world. This has been
  developed into a park with life size replicas of dinosaurs, complete with
  loudspeakers playing Jurasic Park dinosaur calls.

  We had a tour of the quarry, showing us hundreds of footprints beloning to
  four distinct groups of dinosaurs. The most impressive were the huge, circular
  sauropod tracks and the smaller, pointier teropods (mainly carnivores).

  Afterwards, a Spanish-speaking guy offered us all a lift in the back of his
  pickup which we accepted (once we understood). He dropped us nearish the
  centre, but we got a taxi to avoid walking the thin roads. Wilson and Sita
  showed us a great fruit juice stall in the central market, with a wide
  selection of cheap fruit and a free refill.

  We searched together in vain for several recommended lunch places, then left
  Wilson and Sita and bought some salteñas (large empanadas) at a nearby bakery.
  Ok, so we also had some sweet treats too. We followed this up with a
  "chocolate espresso" (a chocolate shot), a speciality of the chocolate shop
  Chocolates Para Ti we'd visited earlier.

  We spent the afternoon at the Treasure Museum, learning more about how gold,
  silver, copper and gemstones were (and still are) mined in Bolivia.
  Particularly interesting was bolivianite - a combination of amythest and
  citrine, found only in Bolivia.

  While we were in the museum, loud bangs sounded in the central plaza outside.
  According to our guide in the museum, loud protests like this are common in
  Sucre and we'll see more when we make it to La Paz. Everything had calmed
  down by the time we left, though.

  We spent the end of the afternoon at our hostel and the park outside with a
  smaller replica (orange) Eiffel tower. I tried to phone Rowan, but ended up
  just texting him due to lack of decent internet. Rosie and I had a decent
  Italian meal (great gnocchi) in a small restaurant beside a big group of
  English-speakers currently attending a Spanish school - popular here because
  Bolivia is cheap and Bolivians speak very clearly, if quickly.

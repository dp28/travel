  Today was a traveling day, so not much to report. We were up early (5.30am) to get to the airport
  for about 6.15 for our 7.40 flight. The airport was tiny - there were _maybe_ three other people
  going through security. The only (minor) excitement was that I found the key to our hotel room in my
  pocket. Damn. <R> Sigh </R>

  We flew back into Bangkok and caught a six hour bus to Trat. We're just spending a night in Trat on
  our way to Koh Mak, an island nearby. We managed to avoid a brief deluge, getting into our guest
  house minutes before it started. Afterwards we sampled many different small dishes at the local
  night market, including (of course) another load of delicious deep fried foods - spring rolls, tofu,
  and noodles. In some ways it's not healthy, but food that we see being deep fried is probably less
  likely to give us food poisoning. That, and it's incredibly good with the variety of sweet chilli
  sauces here.

  This was the day I was looking forward to most, at least within the first few weeks of our trip. We
  had booked the Gibbon Experience - three days spent in the jungle trying to spot wild gibbons,
  sleeping in treehouses and ziplining between them. For quite a long time I've had a semi-serious
  running joke that ziplines should be used in more places as a form of transport - I think they lend
  themselves equally well to areas with tall buildings or large hills, plus they are far more
  enjoyable than other means of transport. <R> Just for anyone who doesn't know, when Daniel says
  "semi-serious running joke" he means that every time we are somewhere high he will mention that
  this would be a great place for a zip-line. Every single time... </R>

  Anyway, I'm getting a bit distracted. We dropped off our stuff at the main office, had a rushed
  breakfast, watched a safety video, then crammed into a tiny songthaew with four other people. It
  turned out being packed together so tight probably made it easier to stay in the back without
  getting bounced out. After an hour and a half on tarmac, we stopped, picked up a few dozen eggs and
  a can of beer for those that wanted it, then drove through a river onto an incredibly bumpy dirt
  track for 40 minutes. The beers were gone fast - every bump of the road caused them to froth more
  and more out of the can.

  After having lunch in the village we stopped at, we trekked up through the jungle to a couple of
  huts and some locals playing a game somewhere between volleyball and football. We collected our
  harnesses and the group of 20 was divided into treehouse groups. Rosie and I ended up with four
  others heading for treehouse seven.

  In our smaller group, we made our way to our treehouse both by walking and by zipline. The wires
  were rigged in such a way that they eliminated some parts of the path, with one zipline out and
  another nearby for the journey back.

  The flights themselves were fantastic. Spectacular views of the jungle both near and far, hundreds
  of metres long and many over a hundred metres high. Each was slightly different in terms of speed
  towards the end, so we had to hold our feet up to try and go faster or squeeze a bit of old tire
  around the wire above us to act as a brake. Sometimes I wouldn't quite make it to the end, so would
  have to grab the wire and haul myself hand-over-hand to the end. After getting off, we had to hit
  the wire three times in a row to send a signal to the other side, letting them know it was safe to
  go.

  The final zipline was to our treehouse. It was 25 metres from the ground, or at least, to the bottom
  storey (landing platform, toilet and shower). The middle storey was the largest, with space for four
  double mattresses & mosquito nets, a large, low table, ten stools and a sink with running drinking
  water. The top storey was about five metres up, a little crow's nest with a single mattress to sit
  on.

  We revelled in the view. We had a spectacular view down the valley, surrounded completely by jungle.
  The sun was setting just out of sight behind the trees as we took it in turns to have a shower -
  surprisingly, the shower was the place with the best view in the treehouse. It was amazing, at least
  until plunging into the freezing shower water.

  Our dinner arrived by zipline - there was a small collection of huts nearby that served as our
  kitchen, with five or six people living there, including our two guides (at least for these two
  nights). It was delicious and plentiful, with four different dishes along with sticky rice and tiny
  oranges to follow.

  We ended the night swapping magic tricks and card games with our guides, primarily "magic" Mike (or
  "monkey" Mike as he also told us to call him). We played spoons, which was great fun, but probably
  scared away any interesting animals. I learnt a new game, called "game".

  ## Rules to "Game"

  *Decks*: 1 or 2
  *Players*: 4+, in pairs

  * Each pair decides on a secret signal to give when one of them has 4 of a kind
  * Pairs sit opposite each other in the circle
  * Each player is dealt 4 cards by the dealer
  * One player in each pair looks at their hand, then gives it to their partner
  * The partner chooses any 4 out of the 8 cards they hold to keep, then returns the remaining 4
  * The dealer deals 4 cards face up in the centre of the table, then counts to three out loud
  * All players grab up to two cards that they need to form 4 of a kind, then discard into the middle
  * Once no one wants to swap cards with the middle, the dealer replaces the middle cards & counts
  * Once a player has 4 of a kind, they make the signal to their partner
  * The _partner_ then can say "game", ending the round, scoring 1 point for that pair
  * Alternatively, the partner can try and also get 4 of a kind, then say "double game", scoring 2
  * However, if another player sees the secret signal and says "stop the game", the pair scores -1
  * The first pair to 5 wins

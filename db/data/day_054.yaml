  We were up at 6.45 - 7am to catch a 7.30am boat. We had a very cheap and tasty
  breakfast of roti at a local Indian restaurant, then made our way to a dive
  shop. Originally, we'd planned to come to Semporna to scuba dive, but I've had
  a cold for the last week and a blocked nose prevents you equalising pressure
  when you dive. Instead we decided to snorkel at a similar place.

  The dive shop was heaving, full of activity. We got fins, masks and shorty
  wetsuits, then headed out to a boat with five other tourists. We were going to
  an island called Mabul about 45 minutes from Semporna. The boat journey was
  loud, but scenic. We saw just how much of the small towns in the area were built
  on the water on stilts or jetties and how much rubbish there was in the sea.
  Over the course of the day, the boat had to stop and reverse three times to
  clear out plastic that had become entangled with the propellers.

  Once we got to the island, we had a brief stop for the divers to get more kit,
  then headed to the south of the island. The water was incredibly clear, so we
  could see that the island was surrounded by a large shelf of reef, sloping down
  from the beach gradually until reaching four to eight metres, then falling
  away rapidly. The boat stopped quite far out, but not that deep, maybe five or
  six metres. Most of the others with us were diving, but one woman was
  snorkeling with us. The three of us and our guide put on our fins and jumped in.

  It was fantastic. The water was fairly warm, the visibility was great (maybe
  thirty metres) and there was so much life. Fish everywhere, coral below us,
  deep blue ocean to our left with the occasional shadowy forms of larger shoals
  or divers. There was a gentle current pulling us along the reef, so for the most
  part we just drifted along, looking at the multitude of fish and colours below
  us.

  We didn't only see fish. We'd been hoping to see turtles and we weren't
  disappointed. We saw somewhere between ten and twenty throughout the day, some
  of them massive. We even saw three together and saw another swim up for air. At
  one point we also saw a sea snake, which I hadn't really been hoping for as
  they're venom is potent enough to kill us all multiple times over. It didn't
  seem to fussed by us, though.

  The day passed quickly. We had three snorkeling sessions, each about 45 minutes
  to an hour. In between, we stopped on the island, where decent food was
  provided. Many other westerners were staying there at the resort and we talked
  to a couple of Californians. There were plenty more of the local houses on
  stilts - a surprisingly large number, given that the island is so far from the
  coast and so small, maybe about a twenty minute walk in circumference.

  Unfortunately, like Semporna, there was a lot of litter. It was particularly
  noticeable during our first swim as we spent a while trying to avoid plastic
  in the water. This decreased over the day, but seemed to be replaced by
  jellyfish. They were small, about the size of a ping pong ball, and in the
  afternoon they were everywhere. Apparently they weren't dangerous, but they
  could definitely sting. We both ended the day with the feeling of pinpricks
  on the exposed parts of our bodies and gratefully accepted some vinegar to rub
  into them. <R> I apparently react to their stings much more than Daniel and even
  now have lots of little red dots all over my forearms and legs. I was very glad
  for the wetsuit and mask which protected most of my body. </R>

  Overall, it was an amazing experience. I loved duck diving down to peer into the
  coral, trying to capture it on the GoPro. I did end up taking quite a lot of
  video - I don't envy Rosie trying to edit it. <R> Thanks Daniel... </R>

  We took a different boat back to the mainland with a different group of people
  as the people we'd traveled with were staying the night. Back in Semporna, we
  booked a bus for tomorrow and got some dinner. We found a couple of new tasty
  dishes: roti kandar (roti with a curry on top with a fried egg on top of that) <R>
  new favourite </R> , and roti tissue (roti cooked in a single layer rather than folded,
  making it crispy, then quickly formed into a large cone and drizzled with condensed milk).

  Back at our accommodation we had surprisingly decent showers, but spent a long
  time trying to find someone to pay. We left our room several times when we heard
  voices and eventually, after a couple of hours, found someone who claimed to
  work there and paid them. The snorkeling was great, and it was worth coming
  here, but I'll be glad to leave.

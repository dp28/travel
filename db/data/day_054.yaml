:entry: "We were up at 6.45 - 7am to catch a 7.30am boat. We had a very cheap and
  tasty\nbreakfast of roti at a local Indian restaurant, then made our way to a dive\nshop.
  Originally, we'd planned to come to Semporna to scuba dive, but I've had\na cold
  for the last week and a blocked nose prevents you equalising pressure\nwhen you
  dive. Instead we decided to snorkel at a similar place.\n\nThe dive shop was heaving,
  full of activity. We got fins, masks and shorty\nwetsuits, then headed out to a
  boat with five other tourists. We were going to\nan island called Mabul about 45
  minutes from Semporna. The boat journey was\nloud, but scenic. We saw just how much
  of the small towns in the area were built\non the water on stilts or jetties and
  how much rubbish there was in the sea.\nOver the course of the day, the boat had
  to stop and reverse three times to\nclear out plastic that had become entangled
  with the propellers.\n\nOnce we got to the island, we had a brief stop for the divers
  to get more kit,\nthen headed to the south of the island. The water was incredibly
  clear, so we\ncould see that the island was surrounded by a large shelf of reef,
  sloping down\nfrom the beach gradually until reaching four to eight metres, then
  falling\naway rapidly. The boat stopped quite far out, but not that deep, maybe
  five or\nsix metres. Most of the others with us were diving, but one woman was\nsnorkeling
  with us. The three of us and our guide put on our fins and jumped in.\n\nIt was
  fantastic. The water was fairly warm, the visibility was great (maybe\nthirty metres)
  and there was so much life. Fish everywhere, coral below us,\ndeep blue ocean to
  our left with the occasional shadowy forms of larger shoals\nor divers. There was
  a gentle current pulling us along the reef, so for the most\npart we just drifted
  along, looking at the multitude of fish and colours below\nus.\n\nWe didn't only
  see fish. We'd been hoping to see turtles and we weren't\ndisappointed. We saw somewhere
  between ten and twenty throughout the day, some\nof them massive. We even saw three
  together and saw another swim up for air. At\none point we also saw a sea snake,
  which I hadn't really been hoping for as\nthey're venom is potent enough to kill
  us all multiple times over. It didn't\nseem to fussed by us, though.\n\nThe day
  passed quickly. We had three snorkeling sessions, each about 45 minutes\nto an hour.
  In between, we stopped on the island, where decent food was\nprovided. Many other
  westerners were staying there at the resort and we talked\nto a couple of Californians.
  There were plenty more of the local houses on\nstilts - a surprisingly large number,
  given that the island is so far from the\ncoast and so small, maybe about a twenty
  minute walk in circumference.\n\nUnfortunately, like Semporna, there was a lot of
  litter. It was particularly\nnoticeable during our first swim as we spent a while
  trying to avoid plastic\nin the water. This decreased over the day, but seemed to
  be replaced by\njellyfish. They were small, about the size of a ping pong ball,
  and in the\nafternoon they were everywhere. Apparently they weren't dangerous, but
  they\ncould definitely sting. We both ended the day with the feeling of pinpricks\non
  the exposed parts of our bodies and gratefully accepted some vinegar to rub\ninto
  them. <R> I apparently react to their stings much more than Daniel and even\nnow
  have lots of little red dots all over my forearms and legs. I was very glad\nfor
  the wetsuit and mask which protected most of my body. </R>\n\nOverall, it was an
  amazing experience. I loved duck diving down to peer into the\ncoral, trying to
  capture it on the GoPro. I did end up taking quite a lot of\nvideo - I don't envy
  Rosie trying to edit it. <R> Thanks Daniel... </R>\n\nWe took a different boat back
  to the mainland with a different group of people\nas the people we'd traveled with
  were staying the night. Back in Semporna, we\nbooked a bus for tomorrow and got
  some dinner. We found a couple of new tasty\ndishes: roti kandar (roti with a curry
  on top with a fried egg on top of that) <R> \nnew favourite </R> , and roti tissue
  (roti cooked in a single layer rather than folded,\nmaking it crispy, then quickly
  formed into a large cone and drizzled with condensed milk).\n\nBack at our accommodation
  we had surprisingly decent showers, but spent a long\ntime trying to find someone
  to pay. We left our room several times when we heard\nvoices and eventually, after
  a couple of hours, found someone who claimed to\nwork there and paid them. The snorkeling
  was great, and it was worth coming\nhere, but I'll be glad to leave.\n"

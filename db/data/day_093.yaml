  As a change from our comfortable, sunny days in the mid twenties, today was
  wet, almost constantly. As planned, we used the morning to go La Boca, but
  maybe didn't see as much as we would have on a sunny afternoon.

  La Boca (literally "the mouth") was the first port area of Buenos Aires and is
  apparently a bit dodgy, but has a small, popular, touristy area (aside - I've
  heard a lot of people using "touristic" rather than "touristy" - I didn't
  realise that was a word, so it's always a bit jarring). In that area there's
  a big blue and yellow football stadium, probably the national passtime, and
  a short street lined with buildings painted bright blues, greens, reds and
  yellows as if it had been built out of Lego. Various blogs and guidebooks
  said that it can be crowded and there are groups of people dancing tango in
  the street, but I guess the insistent rain put paid to that today.

  Getting steadily more wet, we didn't stay long. We caught the bus a few stops
  up the road, hen walked through another protest to the National History
  Museum. It was focused primarily on independence, but with bits of other
  periods of history dotted in here and there. We were given a booklet that had
  english translations of **most** of the explanations throughout the galleries
  and made our way through. It was very interesting, but somewhat confusing,
  partly due to ocassional difficulties and translations and that the exhibits
  weren't necessarily chronological. The particularly intriguing bit was how the
  museum identified its own historical significance - it was set up in the late
  1800s as Argentina was trying to forge a single national spirit while also
  encouraging immigration from Europe. Reading between the lines, the museum
  close to deified the figures of the independence movement to inspire unity
  through patriotism, but has since toned this down a bit.

  Afterwards we collected our bags from our hotel and, having checked out
  earlier in the morning, got an Uber (which may have been ordered to stop
  operating here ...) out from the centre to a cooking class. This was held in
  our teacher's house. Saul was an ex-economist who had decided he enjoyed
  teaching people to cook more than his day job. He had a decent kitchen and I'd
  liked the look of the menu we would cook. <R> He was very lovely and personable,
  it kind of felt like being taught how to cook by your uncle. </R>

  He greeted us with a few snacks - olives, cheese, salami and some of his own
  sourghdough. He'd prepared quite a few of the ingredients for our dishes
  beforehand, so the class was a mix of demonstration and hands-on learning,
  but I learnt a lot.

  We started with a rum and dulce de leche semifredo. He whipped the cream, then
  added in a cap of rum per person and the dulce de leche. We scooped the
  mixture into glasses and left it to chill during the rest of the class. They
  were great, surprisingly not too sweet, but maybe a little too rummy.

  Most of what we did was make empanadas. Saul had a light recipe for pastry
  made with more water than lard and a bit of baking powder to make it a bit
  flaky. The pastry was easy to work and needed a bit of kneading, which was
  strange to me seeing most pastry I've made has required trying to reduce the
  amount of time you touch it with warm hands. We left the pastry in the fridge
  while we made the filling.

  Saul had already chopped up the ingredients, so I sauted the onions while he
  described the spices and the roughly minced beef we were using. Once the sauce
  was done it went into the fridge, too, but Saul said normally he would leave
  it to sit to slowly cool for an hour before doing so.

  We then made circles of pastry by working togetjer to roll the pastry out
  using a pasta roller. Saul showed us the versatility of the pastry by covering
  some of the leftovers in salt and backing to create little crackers and dry
  frying a couple of the circles to create simple tortillas that were
  surprisingly good.

  We then made empanadas by putting a dollop of filling on a pastry circle in
  our left hand, forming the filling into a denser "mountain", then slowly
  joining together the sides of the empanada, tilting our left hands and working
  from the bottom up. We then formed a particular crimp that apparently
  indicates that there is beef in the empanada. I wasn't particularly good and
  only really got worse as we went on. We egg washed most of them, but left six
  plain. Once baked, they were pretty good and I actually preferred the non
  egg washed ones. <R> One day I will manage a perfect crimp on a pasty or empanada
  but today was not that day. </R>

  The main course that we made was the classic Argentinian steak. Like most
  steak seems to be here, it was huge - about 700g for the three of us (we
  didn't finish it). Saul covered it in **a lot** of salt and seared it for a
  few minutes on each side. He put it into a dish and covered it with some of
  the juices from the pan and chimmichurri, then roasted it for 17 minutes on
  each side (20 minutes per pound, apparently). <R> It was lovely but there was
  just way way to much steak, I really struggled to finish my piece. I don't know
  how the argentinians eat so much meat. </R>

  Saul had prepared the chimmichurri beforehand, but gave us the recipe. It is a
  traditional sauce which we realised we'd had the previous night and enjoyed.
  Saul told us that the name "chimmichurri" is strange even here. There is a
  story that it comes from British men a few hundred years ago seeing gauchos
  (Argentinian cowboys) preparing it, then saying "give me curry", which has
  been corrupted over the years. <R> This was probably my favourite part of the
  meal, I reckon you could put chimmichurri on just about anything. </R>

  Saul accompanied us to the train station to get back to the centre. We had a
  bus to catch, but plenty of time. Or at least, we thought so, until our train
  repeatedly stopped for much longer than we were supposed to. Eventually
  arriving at the station, we partly walked, partly ran to the bus station, only
  to find that the organisation was a bit of a shambles - a sign said we needed
  stand 43, but someone official looking there said he didn't know where the bus
  was supposed to be. We found the sales desk for our company, who told us it
  would arrive between stands 14 to 25 ...

  We made it onto the bus - which we were to be on for the next 15 hours. Our
  seats were very comfortable with tables that could be erected above them.
  Unfortunately they didn't recline all the way down into a bed as I thought
  they were supposed to.

  There was the end of a film (Arrival) playing in quiet English with Spanish
  subtitles. We watched until the end, then another film started (Before I
  fall). It was on just enough that we wanted to know how it ended, but then it
  was replaced with music stopped for dinner, which we ate some of, and then a
  game of bingo, considerably harder in Spanish. Rosie went to sleep when
  another bad film came on and I tried with little success to write a few diary
  entries, then got some sleep.

  This was a pretty chilled, lazy day for a number of reasons. Primarily, most weather forecasts said
  it was going to rain (it didn't). Secondly, we spent a bit of time working out how much we'd been
  spending, which has a tendency to make both of want to spend less. Thirdly, Rosie's cold isn't
  completely gone, so snorkeling isn't really that appealing. Finally, I wanted to get a bit of
  programming done - writing these posts is a bit more useful if I've got a site to put them on.

  We spent the day by the beach, reading, programming, swimming and going for a bit of a walk to find
  lunch. There are quite a few swings hung from the palm trees, so we had a bit of a play on them,
  too. We spent quite a while looking for a good place for dinner, then headed back to our beach for
  a game of cards (beanie) which Rosie won (in suspicious circumstances - she dealt half of the hands,
  after all).

  PS. Shock of the day: Rosie got sunburnt and I didn't! <R> NOT true! </R>

  Our last day of the tour was the one we'd most been anticipating - the Salar
  de Uyuni or the salt flats of Uyuni, a 4,000 square mile area of white salt.
  We arrived before sunset, stopping in an area with a thin layer of water. The
  colours of the sunrise were incredible, especially reflected in the ground
  below us - probably the most spectacular sunrise I have ever seen.

  We didn't spend too long in the cold, but drove on to an island pushed up out
  of the salt. It was covered in giant cacti and had a great view over the
  flats, so we spent around an hour there. After walking around it and taking
  photos, we had a breakfast of yoghurt, roast quinoa and cake. We took
  advantage of the pure white ground to take perspective-trick photos. Soon, Leo
  got us back in the car, driving us further into the centre of the flats to
  take even better photos. We spent a good while taking a variety of photos and
  ended up with some pretty convincing ones.

  We stopped again at (apparently) the first salt hotel in the world, which was
  a bit of a dump. It did allow us to take the best perspective photo we got -
  a tiny Rosie appearing to stand on my hand. We then had an obligatory stop
  at a local market (we only bought a few postcards), then had lunch in Uyuni,
  our final destination.

  After food (and a brief reintroduction to wifi - it silenced our entire group
  after three days without it), we drove back out of Uyuni to a "train cemetery"
  (exactly what it sounds like), then were dropped off at the office of a bus
  company.

  We were dropped off around 4pm and had an overnight bus at 10pm to Sucre.
  Caitlin and Didi were staying in Uyuni for the night, but Wilson and Sita
  decided to get the bus. They bought their tickets at the office, but we'd
  booked ours online. Apparently we needed to print them out, so we spent
  30-45 minutes trying to find somewhere to print our ticket. Eventually we
  found an internet cafe filled with kids playing computer games, a primary
  teacher printing out tomorrow's teaching aids and a couple of worried-looking
  travellers.

  Wilson and Sita had looked after our bags back at the office. Once we rejoined
  them we looked up the recommended restaurants in our guide book and found
  somewhere with board games. We were the only people in it when we found it,
  but we had a relaxed three and a half hours with a couple of pizzas, a bad
  pisco sour and some pretty decent mulled wine ("vino caliente" is pretty
  common in Bolivia). We had a long game of Ludo (which I probably haven't
  played in 15 years)- Rosie one and came third by the skin of my teeth.

  This was the third night bus of our trip and was definitely the middle in
  quality. The seats weren't the most comfortable, there weren't any films or
  food, but then again we could sit up, recline our seats and no one was
  sleeping partly on me and partly in the aisle.

  **Note** I'm writing this about a week afterwards - due to a few long days and a
  slight issue with a leaking water bottle and wet computer, I haven't written in
  a while.

  This was another traveling day, this time with an early afternoon flight to
  Penang in Malaysia. This could have ended up meaning the morning was a
  write-off, but instead we actually made use of it. It turned out that one of
  Rosie's family friends was getting a boat built in Ho Chi Minh City, so we went
  to see it in the factory. <R> Thanks Bill. </R> We had to be there by 9am, so we
  grabbed a couple of small banh mi from a street stall - bread rolls 30cm long
  and 3cm in diameter filled with paté.

  The factory was outside of the centre, so it was lucky it was still Tet -
  apparently the traffic is normally terrible. We arrived outside a warehouse
  which clearly contained some boats and a guy ran up to us and started talking in
  Vietnamese. Rosie asked repeatedly if he was Mike, the guy we were meeting, and
  he said "Yes", but then seemed to say that to anything we asked. He brought us
  to another guy and eventually into an office where we met Mike, a guy probably
  in his thirties or forties from Kent, with an Australian accent who had been
  living here for the last four years. He showed us around several of the twenty
  or so catamarans in one of their warehouses at different stages in the
  production line. It was fascinating to see the two fibreglass halves of the
  boats - the moulds must be huge as the boats are over 40 feet long. We climbed
  into a boat where the top had already been attached to the hull and into another
  where more of the amenities had been installed.

  We also learnt quite a bit from Mike about living in Vietnam and how it had
  changed while he had been there. He recommended seeing the country by bike,
  which could easily be another trip. He also said that Ho Chi Minh City is
  growing rapidly but that quite a bit of this is due to corruption. Apparently
  it's legal to buy property in cash, so it's an easy way to clean money. He said
  that government officials probably get paid between $20,000 and $40,000, but
  some drive Mercedes costing around $500,000 (taking into account the 220% import
  tax).

  After our visit, we headed back to our guest house, checked out and found some
  lunch. We took another Grab car (South East Asian Uber) to the airport to get
  our plane (it was much easier to leave Vietnam than enter it). The flight was
  fine, but was fumigated at the end as part of Malaysian regulations. <R> There
  was also some pretty serious turbulence on the way in. I don't think I've been
  on a flight where multiple people screamed at the same time before. </R> We landed
  on the island of Penang and took a bus to Georgetown. The buses are branded
  "rapidPenang", but don't quite live up to their name.

  After checking in (and getting a tiny box room with close to paper walls), we
  headed out for dinner. Both starving, we didn't spend too long looking and
  quickly settled down at a nearby Indian restaurant. As we were right beside
  little India, most of the restaurants were Indian. We had a fantastic meal for
  very little money - great curries, naan, chapati and dosa (or "tosai" here).
  All of the bread came with dips, so we were stuffed by the end.

  After dinner, we decided to catch a bus to a large Chinese temple recommended by
  the guy working at our hotel. Because it was Chinese New Year, the entire
  complex had been covered with lanterns and lights similar to Christmas lights.
  It's up on a hill, so was visible from quite a distance from our bus. The
  traffic near it was so bad that we ended up getting out of the bus and walking.
  We had a whistle-stop tour as it was 10.30pm and the buses stopped somewhere
  between 11 and 11.30pm. The temple was spectacular, but mobbed with people.
  Afterwards, we spent quite a while trying to get a bus back, especially as we
  weren't 100% sure which bus we needed. One going our way finally arrived and we
  made it to sleep about 1am. It didn't feel quite as late as that because,
  despite flying two hours primarily west, we've actually gone forward one hour.
  Damn timezones.

  Today was a bit of a lazy day. We started with a few bits of organisation.
  Rosie changed our flights to the US three days earlier to the 7th of June so
  that we would be in San Diego while Bridget is also at home. This meant that
  we only had three weeks left in South America, which suddenly feels very
  short, even if we are ready to go back.

  We also changed hotel, swapping good wifi for a warm shower - definitely worth
  it. We both phoned home over the course of the morning, so the wifi wasn't too
  bad. We had lunch at a nearby Mexican place which ended up being really good.
  We also bumped into Frank and said goodbye as he was heading into the jungle
  for a week.

  I wrote a few diary entries while Rosie edited some photos for most of the
  afternoon. We had dinner at a great restaurant, partly because it has a
  cooking class and we wanted to check it out. Also, the bartender came out and
  made our pisco sours in front of us, letting us taste a couple of different
  piscos to decide which one we wanted. He then proceeded to make it with four
  shots of pisco, not that we could taste the alcohol in the drink. The alpaca
  steak in mango sauce, recommended by our waitress, was fantastic and the
  mashed potato that came with it was perfect.

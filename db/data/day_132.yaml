  We had another 5am start as today was another long day, if not as high as our
  second day. The morning was a steep uphill slog, getting up to a ridge. The
  aim of this was to get to a small set of Incan ruins called Lloctapata with a
  view across another valley to Machu Picchu. At least, that was the idea, but
  when we arrived the view was hidden by clouds. Jose explained some of the
  significance of the buildings (probably religious buildings for a
  self-sufficient town) and he cloud slowly lifted, showing us the ruined city
  in the distance.

  It was a steeper, slippier way down where my walking poles came in handy,
  despite repeatedly slowly decreasing in size. We arrived at a small town near
  a hydroelectric plant and had our final lunch of the trip - with another set
  of fantastic fruit animals. We said goodbye to our porters and our chef,
  Cesar, then followed the railway line to Machu Picchu town (with a few trains
  passing us on the way). On the way we had a brief view of the walls of Machu
  Picchu high above us.

  We checked into a hotel and had a well-earned shower. Well, Rosie did while I
  waited for our luggage to arrive. Unfortunately that meant I only had a couple
  of minutes of a properly hot shower ...

  We spent a bit of time using the wifi before heading out to dinner at a nearby
  restaurant, which was ok but not great. We had an early night after a lot of
  walking and with the earliest morning of our trek to follow.

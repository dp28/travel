  Unfortunately this morning Rosie wasn't feeling that great. We joined a
  walking tour which happened to be with the same company and even same guide
  as Rosie had had four years ago. We learnt about some of Ecuadors's struggle
  for independence and the recent collapse of its currency while also trying
  smoothies made from pretty tasty local fruit. We walked between different
  churches and saw some of the work going on to install a subway which will
  defintely be useful - Quito is very busy and very long, including some suburbs
  it's 50km x 8km soo is hard to get from one side of the city to the other.

  We ended up leaving the tour early because Rosie still wasn't feeling that
  great. We had a snack and some tea at a cafe, then a small lunch. We also
  checked out a local chocolate shop which had won some international awards for
  having the best chocolate in the world (within some category). It did have
  very good hot chocolate - rich but slightly bitter from the dark chocolate.

  Today was defintely food-focused as we also went out to quite a nice Spanish
  restarant. It was pretty small and only had a few other people and the
  guy serving us had developed the menu so knew a lot about the food. We had
  several really great dishes, particularly the salmorejo - a rich, cold tomato
  soup like gaspacho but with thinly cut ham on top of it.

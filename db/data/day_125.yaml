  The major tourist attraction near Arequipa is Colca Canyon, a valley often
  marketed as twice as deep as the Grand Canyon and a great place to see Andean
  condors. Rosie had already been, but we were both still keen to go.

  There are lots of ways to see it, but we opted for a one-day tour. This had
  the drawback of starting at **3am**, meaning we had the earliest start of
  our trip so far: 2.45am. Eugh.

  We got in a bus around 3.15am, and tried to sleep, but to no avail. It didn't
  help that we went up to 4,910m, meaning that our inflatable travel pillows
  repeatedly needed air let out of them. After 6.30am, the inevitable tourist
  stops started, but were pretty interesting: a viewpoint at the highest point,
  a view of the mountain which is where the Amazon river officially starts, and
  a church in a local village (where Rosie was able to get a photo of the
  squirrel on an alpaca).

  The best stop by far, and our main reason for going on the tour, was to see
  the condors. It was higher up in the canyon and when we arrived there were
  between ten and twenty condors soaring above the hordes of people and
  minibuses. The birds were huge and flew surprisingly close, almost rendering
  Rosie's binoculars useless. Rosie got some decent photos and through the
  binoculars I got a couple of reasonable videos of condors in flight and a shot
  of one on the ground. It wasn't just condors, either - we also saw a couple of
  viscachas, somehwere between rabbits, squirrels and kangaroos (apparently).

  On the way back were a few more stops - some hot springs with a rope bridge
  over a river (someone else dropped & lost their bag), another viewpoint over
  the valley to see the terraces, a stop to taste particular cacti ("tuna") and
  a surprisingly decent buffet lunch. It included some form of greenery
  deep fried in tempura batter which was delicious and extremely popular.

  We arrived back in Arequipa at 4.30pm, maybe having acheived half an hour of
  sleep between us. We booked our bus to Cusco in a couple of days with a bit of
  faff, then had a huge Italian dinner (just Rosie's lasagne provided us with
  enough leftovers for both of us for lunch tomorrow).

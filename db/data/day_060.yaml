  Initially, our plan for today had been to go on a tour of the botanical
  gardens. According to Lonely Planet, there were free tours at 8am and 10am.
  However, after not finding any other evidence of these tours on he internet,
  we scrapped the idea of a tour and decided to go later (meaning we could lie
  in a bit). That was lucky, as we needed more time this morning to finish
  some booking.

  Last night, as part of our booking bonanza, we'd decided to go from Singapore
  to Lombok, a smaller Indonesian island. It's not that popular a journey, so
  we either needed to book it through two separate airlines or a single travel
  agency. We used Kiwi, but they required extra documentation checks to validate
  the payment which took a long time. By this morning, it still hadn't worked
  and when we tried again we were more successful, but still had to wait on
  final confirmation. We spent an hour or so working on diary entries and
  photos, but, with no confirmation in sight, gave up and decided to just get on
  with our day. The confirmation did come through, just after another three
  hours or so.

  We walked over to the botanical gardens, stopping for a delicious Indian
  meal and at a pharmacy to replenish our DEET supplies. The gardens are huge,
  including a lake, a deer park and a massive bird park. We considered the bird
  park, but didn't really want to pay quite a bit of money to see birds in
  cages, even if some of them are in large net enclosures.

  We did, however, have a look around the orchid garden and got pretty close to
  a monitor lizard. We also spotted a few groups of segway-riding tourist (I'm
  not jealous, honest), then made our way down to a lake through the deer park.
  For some reason, there were several display cages of chickens in the deer park
  along with similar chickens roaming free. We saw a few deer, but no sign of
  the mouse deer that are supposed to be there.

  Down at the lake, we saw carp, terrapins and an impressive swimming monitor
  lizard. We took some photos and used the free wifi to find some geocache
  locations, managing to find one near the entrance to the park. On our way out
  we successfully located it and added our initials.

  On our way to another cache, we happened upon a museum of Islamic art which
  Rosie had heard was good. It was very interesting, teaching us about the
  spread of Islam, Islamic architecture and weaponry from Europe, Africa and
  Asia. It also had a small exhibition on Palestine and the formation of Israel,
  definitely from the Palestinian perspective. On our way out we spent some time
  at a photography display from Iraq, Syria and Yemen showing before and after
  pictures of buildings that had been damaged or destroyed during conflict.
  Some of the cultural and religious buildings were over a thousand years old -
  several were shown as they were collapsing or exploding.

  Just across from the museum was the national mosque, which is open to visitors
  outside of prayer times. We had a quick look inside and quite a lenghty talk
  with one of the men volunteering or working there about the mosque and Islam.
  We then condinued on to Merdeka (independence) Square, which has more
  impressive architecture. Across the river we found some more great Indian food
  for dinner, then headed back to the hostel.

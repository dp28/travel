  We were only back in Hanoi for a night - this morning we had an early bus out to
  the coast. I tried to get breakfast before the 7.45am bus, leaving our hotel to
  buy banh mi before 7am. There's one particular tiny banh mi shop, Bami Bread,
  that we've been back to a few times because the sandwiches are the best.
  Brilliant sauce, perfect pat√©, an excellent pickle - I may be addicted, <R> he is.</R>
  I actually arrived too early, they hadn't opened yet. It was strange to see the
  roads so empty and the pavements no longer covered in stalls, scooters, and
  people. I came back a little later, got a couple of delicious warm baguettes,
  then caught our bus from our hotel.

  The bus was pretty fancy - it had wifi, <R> (not good wifi, but wifi) </R>
  which is a first for the buses we've had here. We had a ticket all the way to
  Cat Ba island, a large island two buses and
  one boat away from Hanoi. Cat Ba is in an area of huge numbers of limestone
  karsts, shear islands jutting out of jade sea.

  Despite the cloud and haze, we got some excellent views of the area from an old
  cannon fort above Cat Ba town, used in both WWII and the Vietnam war. We spent
  the afternoon there and walking between some of the beaches near the town. We
  booked our activities for the next day and had dinner at a rooftop restaurant.

  After our hotel breakfast of extra crumbly baguettes (made with rice flour and
  very little liquid, so they're way more crumbly than French baguettes), we spent
  a while looking up and booking most of the rest of our time in northern Vietnam.

  We changed our plans quite a bit due to weather and some more information. We'd
  planned to got trekking in Sapa, a mountainous area in the north, but it's going
  to be wet and almost freezing there. Instead, we're going to go to Mai Chau,
  which should also have scenic rice paddies and be good for walking, but be a bit
  warmer, <R>although still pretty cold. </R>

  Similarly, we planned to have a day trip to Halong Bay, a picturesque area full
  of vertical limestone islands. Instead, we're going to go to Cat Ba island for
  two nights. It's nearby, has similar scenery, is less touristy and has some fun
  looking activities.

  After our booking bonanza, we headed out into Hanoi. We're staying in the Old
  Quarter - a warren of small street packed full of scooters blaring their horns
  and driving faster than they were in the other countries we've been in. Many of
  the streets have a specialism where most of the shops sell a particular set of
  goods, eg shoe street or sweets street. Barbecue chicken street is apparently
  very popular. The streets have completely different names (and don't seem to
  have signs), but you can quickly tell what everyone is selling.

  One of the things we'd heard about Vietnam was that the food was great. Our
  first few forays into Vietnamese cuisine did not disappoint. Banh mi in
  particular is delicious - a crusty Vietnamese baguette filled with a pork pat√©,
  grilled (or better, slow cooked / roast) pork, pickle, mayo, some incredible
  sauce and maybe some chilli. We also had Vietnamese egg coffee in a waffle cone
  (although we got the chocolate version rather than coffee). Egg coffee isn't
  as weird as it sounds, it's beaten egg yolk and condensed milk, then mixed
  with coffee (or in our case, drinking chocolate). It's creamy and sweet and
  right up my street. Apparently, it was invented during the (Vietnamese/American)
  war when milk was expensive. <R> Its effectively a heavily beaten custard and was
  sweet and creamy enough to persuade Daniel to try coffee. </R>

  I also had a less pleasant food experience - getting ripped off buying what
  turned out to be not very tasty donuts. A woman was selling sweet-looking
  pastries and I was interested, so she quickly filled a bag, putting in as many
  as she could fit. I'll freely admit that haggling isn't my strong point,
  especially when somewhat rushed by the other person and in a country I've just
  arrived in. I handed over the money, but knew almost immediately afterwards I
  should have refused and only bought the amount I wanted and for a lower price.
  Ah well, it was probably $4 - $5 more than it should have been, but it's a
  lesson learnt.

  We spent the afternoon at the Womens' Museum and the Confucian Temple of
  Literature. The Womens' Museum was fascinating, giving us an insight into
  modern Vietnamese life, tribal customs, religion, the war, the rise of communism
  and independence from France. The interviews with Hanoi street vendors made me
  feel somewhat better about being ripped off and the effects of the war on
  Vietnamese life was staggering, from the tunnels built to the fact that all
  radios had to be registered with the police.

  By far the best bit of the day was our evening food tour. Heavily recommended on
  TripAdvisor, we decided to book one rather than a cooking class as all the
  classes sounded similar to the worse of the two we'd already done.

  The food was fantastic and varied. We had pork meatball soup, dried beef salad,
  steamed savoury pancakes, fried food in "Vietnamese KFC without chicken",
  noodles, more egg coffee and banh mi, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream.
  Everything was tasty and there was just enough - I wasn't hungry and wasn't
  overly full at the end. We probably ate quite a bit over the three hours. <R> I
  was very full and to this day I don't understand where Daniel puts it all. </R>

  Our guide, "Potato", was enthusiastic and informative. We learnt what was in
  each dish, how they were eaten and when. She also taught us about the dangers of
  the Vietnamese language - the same word is used for watermelon, pineapple, and
  coconut, just with different tones. Worse, the same is true for "thank you" and
  "shut up" (something like "come an" vs "come on"). We were a group of ten and
  she managed to keep us together and get us all across the treacherous roads,
  throwing her hands in the air and shouting "Sticky rice!" to group us together.
  I'm amazed it worked - it's so loud on a Hanoian street and she was tiny, even
  with her arms raised we couldn't see her over other people.

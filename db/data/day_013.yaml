  Sleeping in a treehouse has its ups and downs. Sunset - definite up. Rats and squirrels in the
  night, however, don't improve my sleep. We'd stored all our food in a box, but the giant black
  squirrels were happy enough to scurry over our treehouse, pick off bark from the tree, squeaking all
  the while. Coupled with the snoring of one of our treehouse-mates, Rosie and I didn't sleep
  particularly well either night in treehouse seven.

  After a delicious breakfast, we zipped and walked to treehouse one to try and spot gibbons. It was
  the biggest treehouse, sprawling across two trees and at least four levels. Unfortunately we didn't
  see any gibbons (apart from in a video on one of the guides' phones), so we zipped home for lunch.

  The afternoon was more focused on ziplining than wildlife. We visited three other treehouses,
  including treehouse five, almost 50 metres from the ground (apparently the world's highest). At
  another, we saw a bright green snake very slowly moving along a branch of an adjacent tree. We spent
  quite a bit of time at a tree which was the centre of a figure of 8 made up from four ziplines,
  flying from the tree to the ground, walking a bit up hill, then zipping back to the tree. The height
  that we had to walk up to be able to zip hundreds of metres was surprisingly little. I definitely
  think they should be used in more places ...

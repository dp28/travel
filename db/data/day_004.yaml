  To try and capitalise on our (Rosie's) jet lag, we got up at 6.45am to get out
  early. Unfortunately, we lost a bit of time booking the train for Chiang Mai the
  next day, but then went down to breakfast. I tried out some of the Thai food on
  offer - rice and several stews with some chilli sauce.

  Today was our day for seeing some of the main recommended sights of Bangkok -
  the Grand Palace and Wat Pho. The Grand Palace is a former residence of the Thai
  monarchy and also houses the Emerald Buddha (which isn't made from emerald). The
  palace complex is huge and the buildings are incredibly ornate and covered in
  gold. For me, the most interesting (and least crowded) parts were Chakri
  Mahaprasat - a Western-style building with a Thai roof - and a smaller museum of
  items donated to the Buddha, which includes models of what the complex looked
  like when it was built in 1782 and what it is like now. <R> They seem to really
  really like gold and they cover **everything** in it, you would need sunglasses
  even on a shady day, </R>

  We then went to Wat Pho, a temple with a huge reclining Buddha, more intricate
  decorations and a functioning primary school. It was recommended more than the
  Grand Palace primarily for its impressive Buddha and smaller crowds, but the
  significantly cheaper entry price and free water were greatly appreciated.

  We haggled our way onto a tuk tuk to Siam Square and bought lunch at the food
  court in the huge MBK centre. From there, we caught the Skytrain (similar to
  the subway, but built at a level **above** the cars) to Chatuchak weekend
  market. The market was _huge_, a maze of stalls selling anything and
  everything, from a plethora of tourist tat to pet cats.

  Somewhat overwhelmed and overheated, we settled down by a lake in an adjacent
  park to relax for a bit. We were fascinated and somewhat revolted by the size of
  the catfish which fought over the food being thrown into the lake by people near
  by. <R> There was also a turtle </R> After a while, we made our way back to the
  hotel on the subway. We finished off the night with street food and chilling in the rooftop bar.

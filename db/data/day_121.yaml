  We were up and had breakfast in time to get the 8.30am boat from Copacabana to
  la Isla del Sol. The journey took about an hour and a half on a reasonable
  speed boat packed full of people (we passed the time with a wee bit more
  Pokemon, beating the elite four).

  Despite being called the island of the sun, when we arrived it was hailing.
  Hail turned to rain, which in turn fizzled out in about fifteen minutes. We
  waited it out, then headed up onto the island proper.

  Rosie felt she recognised the island from her previous trip to the area, but
  we've since realised that it's just because it's similar. The islands are
  steep and we spent quite a while climbing up the steps to the ridge. We took
  our time - the lake is at 3,810m and the ridge is at about 4,000m. We saw a
  few llamas and some local people setting out their wares after the showers. We
  walked to the top of a couple of hills around the town in the south of the
  island, getting some great views. The rest of the island is out of bounds to
  tourists at the moment due to a local dispute - something about one group
  building on top of another group's sacred site, then the wronged party
  responding by blowing up the offending building with dynamite.

  We had lunch with a great view over lake Titicaca. A lot of places here offer
  a set menu, so we had soup, trout and dessert (drowned in Hersheys' chocolate
  sauce, unfortunately). Everywhere has trout and we found out that it's
  originally Canadian and was introduced.

  We got the bus back with enough time to pick up our luggage and return to the
  dock to catch our bus (and also to squeeze in a strawberry and banana shake).
  We met Wilson and Sita who were also getting the same bus as us, but not
  staying in Puno. We all got on the bus once it arrived and headed for the
  border.

  This was one of the last borders of our trip, but not the easiest. We arrived
  at the Bolivian side and had to leave the bus with all of our luggage as we
  were to get on another bus, owned by the same company, on the other side. We
  lined up to go through customs and changed our remaining Bolivianos into
  Peruvian Soles. Some confusion arose when we were told to have our entry slips
  ready along with our passports. We hadn't been given an entry slip and neither
  had quite a few others. One of the officials took Sita's passport and told her
  that she would have to pay 50 Bolivianos, but no one else in the same
  situation had to pay. Wilson took back the passport and our guide from the bus
  company talked to the official, but didn't get much information. We ended up
  getting through without anyone paying, so we're pretty sure the official was
  just hoping that Sita didn't speak enough Spanish to understand and would
  have just handed over the money. The guide said she'd never seen this in her
  two years there.

  The Peruvian side was a bit more official, but equally frustrating. I got
  through fine, but Rosie had trouble switching passports. As she's a US
  citizen, she should enter the US on her US passport, but until now we've both
  been using UK passports to make things simpler (and cheaper in Bolivia).
  We're flying into Ecuador and from Ecuador to the US, so needed to register
  passports, so it makes sense for that one to be Rosie's US one. Having left
  Bolivia, it should be possible to switch passport and enter Peru on the US
  one, but the customs official insisted on only accepting the passport with the
  Bolivian exit stamp, which should not be necessary as far as we can tell.
  We'll sort it out at the next border.

  Once through the border and onto our fancier, double decker Peruvian bus, we
  saw a fantastic sunset and listened to our audiobook for the couple of hours
  to Puno. When we arrived, we were bundled onto a shuttle bus, which squeezed
  its way through the tiny streets, stopping a couple of blocks from our hotel
  on the main pedestrianised street. The hotel was pretty nice and the prices
  on the wall were more than twice than what we'd reserved online.

  We got some cash out of an ATM (sadly one with foreign transaction charges),
  then scouted out dinner. We ended up at another place with a set menu, the
  best pisco sour Rosie's had in a while and a great mulled wine and pisco
  drink with some kind of fruit juice to sweeten it slightly, served in a hot
  ceramic mug.

  **Note** The last four or five days are missing photos - Rosie is on it, but
  we haven't had good enough internet for the last few days to upload & link
  them.

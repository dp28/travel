  The reason for coming to Sandakan was for the wildlife sanctuaries nearby.
  Specifically, the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre and the Borneo Sun
  Bear Conservation Centre. They're next door to each other, 45 minutes by
  minibus from Sandakan.

  We got the earliest bus (9am, meaning we got to sleep in until just before
  8am!), arriving in time for the 10am orangutan feeding. The centre is situated
  in 43 square kilometres of protected rainforest and rehabilitates orphaned and
  rescued orangutans, slowly weaning them off the need for human-provided help
  and food. Visitors, like us, can see orangutans that decide to come to the
  morning and afternoon feedings, but it's not guaranteed. The food is
  deliberately boring to encourage them to forage for themselves.

  We went to both the morning and afternoon feedings. We weren't lucky in the
  afternoon, probably because it was still slightly raining after an hour of
  very heavy rain. As we saw in the informational video, orangutans don't really
  like the rain, despite living where they do.

  In the morning, however, we were lucky. Four orangutans arrived to get some
  food, swinging through the trees and on the ropes to the platform. They spent
  15 - 20 minutes eating and swinging, several of them grabbing food and
  swinging away along ropes, only to accidently drop their chosen bananas.

  After the feeding, we went to the outdoor nursery where slightly younger
  apes were playing on climbing frames. There's an indoor nursery (where
  tourists aren't allowed) for younger ones, where they probably have a lot more
  human contact. In the outdoor nursery, they're weaned off human contact and
  paired up with an older orangutan to learn skills they would have learnt from
  their mother. While we were there, two slightly different sized orangutans
  spent most of the time having scrappy fights, so it looks like the buddy
  system is kind of like having a sibling (I'm sure all brothers fight like
  that).

  Between the feedings, we headed over to the sun bear centre. Sun bears are the
  smallest bears, only growing to 1.5m (just bigger than an adult male
  orangutan). Like orangutans, they're endangered, often kept as pets and take a
  long time to rehabilitate. They also climb a lot - while we were there, one
  spent ad least an hour sitting in the same tree rooting around for food.

  While in the sun bear centre, an orangutan made its way onto the board walk we
  were on. There were people on all the walks leading to it, so it just sat in
  place for a few minutes, then slowly made its way toward us. One of the
  members of staff got everyone near by to move back and out of the way while
  the orangutan slowly made its way down the board walk and around the corner.
  It kind of felt like someone was coming down the road with a police escort
  moving the public out of the way - the orangutan almost seemed oblivious to
  us.

  Our other run in with an orangutan was back at the visitors' centre of the
  rehabilitation centre in the afternoon. It had been raining hard for a long
  time when a slightly wet orangutan came around the corner of the next building
  and swung across the shelter between that building and ours. We moved back to
  give it space until it left over the roof. A member of staff said he'd seen it
  earlier in a tree nearby tring to make a nest, but had probably given up and
  come looking for better shelter.

  After a great day seeing fascinating creatures in their natural habitats, we
  headed back to Sandakan. We had a reasonable dinner at a rooftop restaurant,
  then I caught up with this diary (it's so easy to fall behind - it took me
  around an hour just to do today and yesterday).

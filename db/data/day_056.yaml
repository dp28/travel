:entry: "The reason for coming to Sandakan was for the wildlife sanctuaries nearby.\nSpecifically,
  the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre and the Borneo Sun\nBear Conservation
  Centre. They're next door to each other, 45 minutes by\nminibus from Sandakan.\n\nWe
  got the earliest bus (9am, meaning we got to sleep in until just before\n8am!),
  arriving in time for the 10am orangutan feeding. The centre is situated\nin 43 square
  kilometres of protected rainforest and rehabilitates orphaned and\nrescued orangutans,
  slowly weaning them off the need for human-provided help\nand food. Visitors, like
  us, can see orangutans that decide to come to the\nmorning and afternoon feedings,
  but it's not guaranteed. The food is\ndeliberately boring to encourage them to forage
  for themselves.\n\nWe went to both the morning and afternoon feedings. We weren't
  lucky in the\nafternoon, probably because it was still slightly raining after an
  hour of\nvery heavy rain. As we saw in the informational video, orangutans don't
  really\nlike the rain, despite living where they do. <R> The video showed a really
  \nhilarious clip of a young orangutan having a massive tanrum because it was \nraining,
  poor little orangutan. </R>\n\nIn the morning, however, we were lucky. Four orangutans
  arrived to get some\nfood, swinging through the trees and on the ropes to the platform.
  They spent\n15 - 20 minutes eating and swinging, several of them grabbing food and\nswinging
  away along ropes, only to accidently drop their chosen bananas.\n\nAfter the feeding,
  we went to the outdoor nursery where slightly younger\napes were playing on climbing
  frames. There's an indoor nursery (where\ntourists aren't allowed) for younger ones,
  where they probably have a lot more\nhuman contact. In the outdoor nursery, they're
  weaned off human contact and\npaired up with an older orangutan to learn skills
  they would have learnt from\ntheir mother. While we were there, two slightly different
  sized orangutans\nspent most of the time having scrappy fights, so it looks like
  the buddy\nsystem is kind of like having a sibling (I'm sure all brothers fight
  like\nthat).\n\nBetween the feedings, we headed over to the sun bear centre. Sun
  bears are the\nsmallest bears, only growing to 1.5m (just bigger than an adult male\norangutan).
  Like orangutans, they're endangered, often kept as pets and take a\nlong time to
  rehabilitate. They also climb a lot - while we were there, one\nspent at least an
  hour sitting in the same tree rooting around for food. <R> \nSun bears are my new
  favorite bears, they are just slightly dopey but very \nadorable for it. </R>\n\nWhile
  in the sun bear centre, an orangutan made its way onto the board walk we\nwere on.
  There were people on all the walks leading to it, so it just sat in\nplace for a
  few minutes, then slowly made its way toward us. One of the\nmembers of staff got
  everyone near by to move back and out of the way while\nthe orangutan slowly made
  its way down the board walk and around the corner.\nIt kind of felt like someone
  was coming down the road with a police escort\nmoving the public out of the way
  - the orangutan almost seemed oblivious to\nus.\n\nOur other run in with an orangutan
  was back at the visitors' centre of the\nrehabilitation centre in the afternoon.
  It had been raining hard for a long\ntime when a slightly wet orangutan came around
  the corner of the next building\nand swung across the shelter between that building
  and ours. We moved back to\ngive it space until it left over the roof. A member
  of staff said he'd seen it\nearlier in a tree nearby tring to make a nest, but had
  probably given up and\ncome looking for better shelter.\n\nAfter a great day seeing
  fascinating creatures in their natural habitats, we\nheaded back to Sandakan. We
  had a reasonable dinner at a rooftop restaurant,\nthen I caught up with this diary
  (it's so easy to fall behind - it took me\naround an hour just to do today and yesterday).\n"

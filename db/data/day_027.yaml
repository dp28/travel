  This morning we got up late (9.30am) and walked a mile or two into Kep, <R> (it was definitely two) </R>
  which seems to have two centres. We had a breakfast of pastries at a French bakery and picked up food
  for lunch. The main activity for the day was to be a walk, so we needed a bit of a picnic.

  The walk was around Kep National Park - a small area of jungle-covered hillside just beside the sea.
  We were given a map and quite a bit of useful advice at a cafe at the entrance to the park, then
  made our way to a butterfly garden on the other side of the park.

  We slowly walked up the wide path in the swelteringly hot and sticky mid day sun, enjoying the view
  and the sight of the occasional bird or squirrel. After about twenty minutes, I heard a movement on
  the edge of the path and turned to see a metre-long hooded snake lying motionless, watching us. I
  quickly pointed it out to Rosie and we all paused for a second to work out how we can get away as
  quickly and safely as possible. A tiny part of me was also trying to work out whether or when to
  stop and take a photo. As I write this I've just looked up snakes in Cambodia and apparently a lot
  of the hooded ones here are cobras, all of which can kill with a bite and some of which can spit
  venom. So I'm fairly glad that we didn't stop to take a photo. It would have made it easier to
  identify, though.

  Seeing the snake did leave us a little on edge for the rest of the time in the national park, except
  for in the butterfly garden. That was relaxing and tranquil (at least, once the loud group of
  school boys left). There were loads of butterflies of plenty of different colours - bright blues and
  oranges with speckles of red and brown. We spent a while taking photos, then left and had some cool
  drinks in the shade. <R> it was just soooo hot </R>

  The place where we had drinks had quite a few dogs, several of which followed / led us as we
  continued our walk around the park. <R> I named them Blackie and Blondie and they were great
  guides. </R> We turned off the main path onto a very steep and overgrown
  trail through the jungle recommended by people from the cafe at the entrance. The dogs had far less
  trouble than us and were somewhat reassuring company - they'd probably be much better at noticing
  any other snakes. We ended up at a spectacular view point looking onto the two sea front centres of
  Kep, separated by another jungle-covered hill, contemplating how great a starting point it would
  make for a zipline.

  Like yesterday, we finished with some cocktails watching the sunset, this time having tapas at the
  same place (much better). The crab was particularly good and is what Kep is known for. I'm not
  normally that into it, but here it was excellent. <R> Guys Daniel ate seafood three times in
  one meal!!</R>

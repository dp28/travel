  Sleeping in a bit meant that we had a rushed morning to make our 9am cooking class on time.
  Unfortunately, this one didn't quite live up to our previous experience. The market visit was
  interesting, both to see what's available and the condition it's sold in (plenty of flies around the
  meat ...). At the restaurant, we had to decide, in our group of nine, which six dishes to make out
  of 27. We shared the prep of all the ingredients, then one person was assigned a recipe to a person
  to cook. We then ate all of the food together.

  Together, this meant we made very little ourselves and weren't really able to experiment with
  flavours as we had been before. However, I did learn quite a bit more about how rice, particularly
  sticky rice, is used in Laos, and got to try, if not make, rice cakes and rice "whiskey".

  Fairly full, we made our way back to the guest house and, because it had come up in conversation,
  took some Myers-Briggs personality tests. These weren't very revealing - they all agreed I'm
  introverted (shock!), but over three tests I was assigned different results for the other three
  categories.

  After that short interval, we tried to catch the sunset from the stupa on the hill in the centre of
  Luang Prabang. The hill is about around 300 steps to the top and has various Buddhist temple
  buildings on it. As we discovered, at sunset it also has  hundreds of people crammed onto the peak.
  We decided to skip the crowds, so went lower and still got a decent view.

  We returned to the night market and sat in a restaurant near the food part which had its own bakery
  stall outside. We tried black rice wine with and without lime juice - a surprisingly good addition.
  I also discovered their banana and avocado smoothie, almost chocolaty in its creaminess. I
  definitely need to replicate that if possible.

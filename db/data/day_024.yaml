  Another traveling day - up at 6am, at Bangkok airport for 7am, flight to Phnom Penh at 9am, arrive
  at 11.30am, bus to Kampot at 1.30pm for 3 hours. All in all, a good opportunity to make it
  significantly further through our books and audiobook.

  Arriving a Bangkok airport two hours before was a good idea. The place is _huge_ and there were a
  lot of lines we needed to stand in. In addition, the airline we were flying with (Bangkok Airways,
  "Asia's Boutique Airline", apparently) has a private lounge for all its customers. Rosie got her free
  tea and we both got our fill of free popcorn, pastry, buns and (bizarrely good) curry ham
  sandwiches. They also included a free meal on our one hour flight. Not bad for $80.

  We had to get visas on arrival in Phnom Penh, which was probably easier & cheaper than e-visas. We
  caught the public bus from outside the airport for $1 (Cambodia uses its own currency, the riel,
  interchangeably with dollars). Getting off relatively centrally, we made our way to one of the many
  small private bus stations to find a bus (in this case minibus) to Kampot.

  While waiting for the bus and on the bus itself we learnt that Cambodian roads are not like Thai
  roads and definitely not like British roads. In Thailand, there's a pavement and you can maybe walk
  on it about half of it, the rest of it being covered with street food carts, someone's moped or a
  sleeping dog. If you want to cross a road, you walk slowly but deliberately across, maintaining a
  constant speed, but still checking that cars or motorbikes will stop. In Cambodia, however, at least
  in the bit of Phnom Penh we were in, there _may_ be pavement, but it doesn't have space for you.
  Neither does the road beside the pavement - it's full of cars parked perpendicular to the pavement
  even though the painted lines are diagonal. You end up walking in the road, into the oncoming sea
  of motorbikes - many of the tuk-tuk-like vehicles here aren't actually a single piece, they're
  just a motorbikes with a detachable trailer. If you want to cross the road you follow the same
  procedure as Thailand, although seemingly fewer people are likely to stop for you. <R> There are
  also a surprising number of Lexuses </R> (Lexi?).

  Driving on larger roads seems to be different, too. Many of the larger roads in Thailand had
  completely separate roads going either direction. Not so in Cambodia. There, it's completely normal
  to overtake into oncoming traffic (as long as you sound your horn), meanwhile there's a good chance
  that someone on a motorbike is undertaking the same vehicle you're overtaking.

  After that somewhat exciting bus journey, we were taken by an old, dying tuk tuk to our booked
  accommodation. It's a slightly bigger box than we've had so far, this time on stilts. The roof may
  or may not be waterproof and the walls do not meet the roof - making it somewhat less private than
  Rosie would like while changing. It does have a decent sized mosquito net, however, but with a fair
  few holes. It's even got its own large gecko, patrolling parts of the ceiling. <R> I named him
  Bertram and he chirped happily through the night.</R>

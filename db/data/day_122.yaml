  For the first time in what feels like ages we had a decent shower available
  this morning. It was hot, had good pressure and we didn't have to decide on
  one or the other (a lot of the showers recently have only been reasonably warm
  if the pressure was really low). Even better, it remained hot for the entire
  shower. <R> The only problem with it was that it made the entire bathroom wet
  as well, but I'm not complaining. </R>

  As we're in Peru for pretty much a month, Rosie really wanted to have mobile
  data available. She'd found a coule of providers and we went to find their
  shops. They all seemed packed full of people queueing, so we joined the line
  in a slightly emptier one. Once we reached the front, the woman serving us
  seemed not to have sold a SIM to a non-Peruvian before, so it took a while.
  Time was getting short as we had a tour booked, so I left to go and buy lunch
  (at a delicious bakery near our hotel).

  <R> After finding someone who did know
  how to sell a sim to a non-Peruvian she slowly managed to fill out the form
  while I sat there silently (and then probably not so silently) panicking that
  I was not going to make it back in time. She finally managed to fill out all
  the required forms, which needed my finger print, before sending me over to another
  place to pay and a third to actually pick up the sim. She assured me all was fine
  (although two days later the sim still hasn't activated) and I ran (sprinted) out
  of the shop, I had exacly 1 minutes to get 10 minutes across town at 3,800 meters.
  Fortunately I managed to flag a taxi and after some confusion (mainly due to me
  being very out of breath) he dropped me at the closest place a car can get to
  our hotel. I sprinted the last 500m and dropped panting into a sofa at the hotel.
  I do not recommend sprinting around at this altitude no matter how acclimatized
  you think you are.
  </R>

  Rosie arrived, panting from her rush back to the hotel, five minutes before
  someone came to pick us up for our tour. The main thing to do from Puno is to
  see the floating islands on lake Titicaca (or "Titihaha in the local language)
  made out of reeds, so we got on a bout full of other tourists for a half hour
  trip to the Uros floating islands.

  We disembarked onto a reed island with a slightly weird texture under foot. We
  gathered together on a reed bench while our guide and the island's president
  told us about the island. There were 21 people living on it and there are
  around 90 islands, each with their own president. The island is built from
  1.5m deep blocks of reed roots in earth, held together with stakes and rope
  for a few months until the roots join the blocks together. Then a further 1.5m
  metres of reeds are piled on top to make a platform, then reed huts built on
  top of even higher reed piles. The floor of the island is replenished with
  reeds every fifteen days.

  The people of the islands survive on tourism, so we had a look at their
  various handicrafts and paid for a trip in the large catamaran reed boat (kept
  afloat by several thousand empty plastic bottles in the hulls, then wrapped
  with reeds and decorated with slightly demonic reed cats' heads at the front).
  Several of the larger buildings, probably not made from reeds, were the three
  primary schools. For further education, all the kids need to go to Puno.

  Our last stop was a larger island with some small shops and restaurants. We
  got a passport stamp (by the sounds of it an idea copied from Cusco, but a
  decent stamp none the less) and plenty of photos. Rosie found that she could
  buy Cheetos, a US brand not easily found in the UK, so we enjoyed a packet
  of them before getting back on the boat.

  Back in Puno, we spent a long time in the cafe part of the bakery I'd bought
  lunch at. They had wifi and a plug, so I passed the time getting the diary up
  to date and programming.

  It was raining when we left, but our chosen restaurant was very close by. We
  had a really good meal, especially my alpaca steak in a sweetish red wine
  sauce with raisins and excelllent mashed potatoes. It was pretty cold, so the
  glass tankards of mulled wine also helped. <R> A tankard of mulled wine is quite
  alot of mulled wine though. </R>

  We returned to our hotel to get picked up for our evening bus. We waited in
  the small lobby while a Spanish-dubbed CGI film played. It was a ridiculous
  film about, as far as we could tell, a bullfighter who didn't want to kill the
  bull, but it was hilarious in how over the top parts of it were.

  We were picked up in a minibus around 9pm. The minibus quickly filled up,
  including one girl who seemed really pretty sick and her friend who wasn't
  quite sure what to do. Rosie gave her some antacids and some advice, but there
  wasn't much else we could do.

  The bus was a bit of a disappointment. The company we've booked half of our
  buses here with claims to be the best, but doesn't quite live up to that
  claim. Rosie's seatbelt didn't work on one and my footrest didn't extend
  today, but worst so far was that our overnight bus, from 9.30pm to 5am,
  stopped at midnight and we had to change buses. This completely disrupted an
  already bad night's sleep and doesn't endear us to the company ...

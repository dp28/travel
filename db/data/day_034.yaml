  Today was a **long** day. We got up at 4.30am, donned helmets and head torches,
  picked up our takeaway breakfast and got on our tandem. The aim was to get to
  Angkor Wat, a huge temple and city, for sunrise. First, we needed to cycle about
  ten miles to the ticket office and the national park.

  The cycling was easier than the night before - much less traffic and we were
  more accustomed to the bike. <R> Although not, as we were to learn the hard way
  accustomed to the saddles. </R> We made reasonable time, primarily because we
  didn't need to stop to navigate. Rosie, on the back, could check Maps.Me on her
  phone while I did all the steering. <R> I have to say Daniel is really very good
  at steering. </R> After a few bumpy roads we made it to the
  huge moat around Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world (1.5km
  by 1.3km). It was the capital city of the Khmer Empire and has a huge temple
  at the centre and is stunning at sunrise.

  Unfortunately, lots of other tourists also know this. We stayed for the
  spectacular sunrise, <R> being jostled by enthusiastic asian tourists the whole
  time </R> then hopped back on our bike and continued to another
  ruined city within the park, Angkor Thom, with another incredible temple at its
  centre. Bayon is possibly more impressive than Angkor Wat, with a maze-like
  interior and 37 towers all with a huge face carved onto each side. Better yet,
  as we had left so early, there weren't many other people there for most of the
  time we were there.

  As the sun came up more and more tourists arrived. The park is huge and there
  are so many impressive, ruined temples, almost all mobbed by crowds of tourists
  of all varieties. We saw people with cameras on tripods with the umbrella-like
  attachments to modify the camera's flash. We saw plenty of tourists with money
  belts on outside their clothing (how is that useful?) and plenty more dressed to
  the nines for all the photos they were taking. <R> I was particularly impressed
  by the woman wearing stiletto heels and a bright pick mini skirt through a mostly
  broken down temple and the people taking their wedding pictures there. </R> We
  even saw another couple on a bright pink tandem (theirs didn't have flowers on
  the front, though <R> they were totally jealous of the flowers </R>).

  The temples were incredible. We saw one which was essentially an island on a
  pond on an island in a small lake on an island in a huge resevoir only a hand
  deep, littered with half-dead trees. Several of the gigantic temple complexes
  have been reclaimed by the jungle, surrounded by trees. Some massive trees are
  actually growing out of the walls, looking like they have been poured onto the
  stone.

  We spent the day cycling from temple to temple, ending up with sunset at a
  temple on top of a small hill. We braved the traffic in a hectic cycle back into
  Siem Reap, dropped off the bike, had a quick dinner and fell into bed,
  shattered.

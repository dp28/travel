  This was our last day in Cambodia. We had took the opportunity to have a proper
  lie in (8.30am - four hours on the day before!). We had breakfast, then I spent
  quite a while writing up the last couple of days as we'd been too busy and
  exhausted to write them up on the day.

  On the recommendation of our friendly and useful host, Han, we tried to go on a
  free tour of a silk farm in the afternoon. Unfortunately, the bus was fully
  booked, so we had a free tour of their other workshops at their Siem Reap
  premises. They had quite a few different workshops - woodwork, enamel, ceramics,
  silver-coated bronze, and stonework among others. It was impressive to see,
  especially after we were able to have a go at some of the stone carving. It was
  pretty difficult to form any sort of regular pattern, but some of what they were
  producing was incredibly intricate.

  As it was our last day, we spent a little while shopping for a few souvenirs.
  Neither of us are that into shopping, so that didn't last that long. We headed
  back to our hotel to do a little programming and have some dinner. We got a tuk
  tuk to the airport (which was pretty slow because it got a flat tire half way
  there).

  We expected the usual airport faff not to take to long - it's not that big an
  airport. However, we'd never flown with Vietjet before. They may be cheap, but
  they're strict. Vietnam has complicated visa rules and seems to make the
  airlines enforce them. You don't need a visa for the first 15 days, unless
  you've been there before. To check people in, the airline officials had to
  triple check all the stamps in their passports because apparently they'll be
  fired if they mistakenly let three people through. Needless to say, the queue
  took a **long** time.

  Despite the wait, everyone seemed to make it through, including both the guy
  who kept trying to cut his way into the line (and being rebuffed by everyone
  else) and the British couple just getting a transfer in Vietnam who were
  forced to buy a $400 visa online before they could check in. <R> That is a very
  expensive 2 hours. </R>

  The flight itself was fine, but I could have lived without the same two songs
  being repeated over and over <R> you just have to embrace the cheesy pop music
  Daniel </R>. Immigration in Vietnam was a breeze - all the hard
  work had already been done for them. We got a taxi from the airport as tuk tuks
  don't seem to be a thing here. Our hotel is fine, if noisy and a bit cold -
  Hanoi is about 15 Celsius and we're used to 25 to 35. The room may have a fan
  and air con, but they're not necessary.

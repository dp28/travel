  After a proper lie in (to 9.15), we got up in time to make proper use of the guesthouse breakfast,
  not just rush through it. Our plan for the rest of the day was to visit Kuang Si waterfall, which
  seemed to be _the_ main attraction in Luang Prabang. At least, every time we walked past a tuk tuk
  or songthaew driver their standard question was simply "Waterfall?".

  We wandered up to one of the main places to find tuk tuks, haggling with a few. We knew it was
  cheaper to share the 27km journey with others, so we wanted to find drivers with other people heading
  that way. After a few minutes, one guy said that he could find us one to share and brought us to his
  friend's almost full Toyota Commuter (not as common as in Thailand, but still _everywhere_). This
  seems to be a common way of doing things in Laos - lots of drivers and stall owners seem to work
  together, sharing business so that the person who can most easily provide the goods or service does
  and presumably the group benefits. <R> I will say that this is the only thing about Laos that I could
  really think of as communist, despite technically being a communist county its really hard to
  work out what means in real terms for the people living here. This was a running source of confusion
  for me through out Laos and Vietnam. </R>

  The waterfall was fun and quite impressive, particularly given that we've now seen quite a few in
  quick succession. We walked up to the top, had a go on a swing only just above a pool at the top
  (and ended up with wet feet). After an ice cream lunch we had a bit of a swim in one of the
  "refreshing" pools below the main falls.

  Also contained within the waterfall park area was a "Free the Bears" moon bear rescue centre. Fairly
  large black bears, their bile is apparently highly prized for its restorative powers. There were
  about a dozen bears and cubs in enclosures, rescued from bile farms or from being kept as pets. It
  was hard to tell exactly what the intent of the sanctuary was - there didn't seem to be much said
  about releasing the bears, but neither were they really being used as a tourist attraction, given
  that entrance was free after paying to get in to the waterfall park.

  Back in Luang Prabang, we had the best meal of our trip so far. It was in a small restaurant on the
  main street, specialising in a fusion of French and Lao cuisine. I had laap - a traditional local
  salad made from minced chicken, plenty of herbs, spring onions and fried garlic - followed by slow
  cooked pork belly, rice, banana flower, carrots and lemongrass. Rosie had a trio of dips followed
  by a Thai shrimp bisque. I normally don't like bisque, but the creaminess combined with a lot of the
  flavours we've been having in local food and cooking with was amazing <R> seriously amazing! </R>

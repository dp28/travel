  What's the best thing to do after spending 21 hours on bus? Another bus
  journey of course! I can assure you I wasn't this chipper this morning getting
  onto our eight hour bus from Lima to Huaraz. We were both thoroughly bored of
  our audibooks, the semi-functional screens playing films, games, and bus
  travel in general. The scenery was occasionally of some help - towards the end
  we had some stunning views of the white peaks in the Cordillera Blanca, but
  for the most part we had either never-ending Lima or never-ending desert.
  Just a touch dull overall.

  We arrived (late) and checked into our hotel, then headed out to another
  pretty good pizza place. Normally, dessert portions are smaller than main
  courses, but not there. The nutella pizza we ordered was probably the same
  size as my pizza, but folded in half and served with a massive ball of ice
  cream.

  The slight problem with Cat Ba is that there isn't much to do (that we're
  interested in) besides the bay. There's a national park, but it's a scooter ride
  away from town and neither of us were keen to ride one - we'd seen enough people
  with evidence of scooter accidents on them. It would have been a difficult cycle
  on poor quality bikes and the few places that had decent reviews for guided
  tours weren't running any today because of Tet. We therefore changed our bus
  from later in the afternoon to earlier to get a bit more time in Hanoi.

  Hanoi was heaving, today is apparently the last normal day before the Tet
  holiday, so everyone is busy buying stuff. We joined in, getting Rosie a soft
  shell jacket (she's jealous of mine). <R> It just looked so comfy, also where else
  can you get a totally genuine north face jacket for $15. </R>  We also had some more
  cream puffs (I need to learn to make choux pastry, it seems like a great way to
  disguise that you're basically just eating cream).

  The real high point of today was the food. First, we stumbled upon a stall
  selling freshly baked "rotiboy" - a soft bread bun with a crispy top and
  melted butter on the inside. Apparently they originate from Malaysia, where they
  are called Mexican coffee buns and have a crispy coffee topping. I had a vanilla
  one and it was exquisite.

  We managed to find a pub with a range of stouts that Rosie enjoyed, then headed
  to an interesting-looking restaurant which had pork with caramel sauce on the
  menu. I'd heard that this was a Vietnamese dish and was looking forward to
  trying it. It did not disappoint. Slow-cooked meat full of flavour, dripping
  with a small amount of rich, sweet sauce, a few slices of chilli and spring
  onion with several braised quails' eggs. Different and delicious.

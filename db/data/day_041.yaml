  Today was fantastic. The main reason for coming to Cat Ba was to see the
  limestone karst landscape, which we had ample opportunity to do. Cat Ba is near
  Lan Ha bay, which is a maze of shear-cliffed islands, hidden lagoons and
  floating villages. It's just south of the better-known Halong Bay, but
  apparently the same landscape, less polluted and with fewer tourists.

  We had booked a tour with a highly-rated adventure tour company, Asia Outdoors,
  to go kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. After a short bus journey from
  their office, we piled into a large-ish boat (an old junk) along with about 15
  others heading out kayaking and climbing. We chatted with a few people as
  climbers were dropped off and had about an hour's journey to our kayak spot.

  We were in a group of five with two guides, almost everyone being from the UK or
  Ireland. There was a father and son from England and an Irish guy who'd just
  quit his job and was traveling before a career change. Our guides seemed like
  seasoned travelers, one of whom was aiming to teach sustainable adventure
  tourism in New Zealand, but struggling with visa regulations. It was a fun
  group as everyone was reasonably laid back.

  The scenery was stunning even if there was no sign of the sun and it was a tad
  cold. The tide was really low, so the eroded undersides of all the islands were
  exposed. Each island had an overhang several metres deep all the way around it
  caused both by the sea and the huge numbers of large barnacles visible on the
  rock that would normally be underwater. Along the water's edge were all sorts
  of little caves and archways where the stone had eroded in odd patterns. These
  also occurred on a large scale too - we kayaked under several arches and into
  two lagoons almost invisible from the outside. Once, we got out of the kayaks
  into what could have been the mouth of a cave, except inside there was no
  ceiling, just walls of rock at least 50 metres high on all sides.

  It was a brilliant morning. We took it slowly, following our guide and paddling
  between the islands. It's a disorientating landscape - without a guide we would
  easily have become lost. The rocks were sharp, the water often shallow and
  some passages very narrow, so we had to try quite hard to have fine control over
  the motion of the kayak to get in and out of lagoons. <R> Fortunately by this point
  Daniel and I are were experienced kayakers by this point, much to the relief of
  our guide who I think was concerned that we were going to have argument mid way
  round the bay. According to him kayaking is a make it or break it moment for most
  couples. </R>

  After kayaking, we returned to the boat, which then picked up all the climbers.
  We also dropped off two staff members at "party island" which the staff were
  all disparaging about. It's a group of fairly plush huts and a bar on one of the
  islands, all built on a beach of imported sand. The owners have a deal with the
  tour company to provide some climbing instruction as an activity. The
  instructors end up having to decide whether the people they're helping have had
  too much to drink to be allowed to climb. <R> It sounds horrendous. </R>

  The boat crew prepared us a delicious lunch - similar fare to what we'd had in
  Mai Chau, but so much better. Rice, surprisingly good potatoes, battered fish
  and great spring rolls (deep-fried, of course). The boat crew were all locals
  and lived on the boat, shouting to each other in Vietnamese. The guides were all
  European, Australian or American, as were the tourists, and the two groups
  seemed to coexist without really interacting except for lunch.

  After eating, we headed back out towards where we'd kayaked to do some paddle
  boarding. As we were on our way, the clouds burned off and we got some great
  views of the black and white cliffs against the emerald sea.

  We were paddle boarding with the Irish guy we'd kayaked with and a couple from
  Seattle. Our guide was from Edinburgh but had been out here for seven months.
  Paddle boarding in the sun was excellent - it would have been worth coming here
  just for the morning's kayaking, but the paddle boarding was even better. We saw
  hundreds of underwater baskets used to farm oysters in the shallower water. The
  water was so low the we both got our boards' fins caught in the baskets at some
  point, but it was so calm that we could easily rectify the problem. As well as
  enjoying the scenery we also collected some plastic waste that floated past us
  which Asia Outdoors would recycle.

  We paddled past plenty of floating homes and floating villages. These are little
  sheds on anchored platforms surrounded by fish farms and often with several dogs
  prowling along the walkways, ready to bark at strangers. There weren't many
  other tourist boats, but some of the local boats were pretty odd. One was made
  from concrete and had been converted into a house with brick walls, anchored
  about 20m off shore.

  Having had a terrific day, we got back to Cat Ba town about 5.30pm. We had a bit
  of trouble finding dinner due to Tet (Vietnamese lunar new year), which is in a
  few days. The first restaurant we tried, which had been recommended, was shut.
  The second was only doing pizza and didn't have all the ingredients yet. We
  ended up at an ok place with decent pancakes - a necessity on pancake Tuesday.

  The vast majority of today was spent on buses. I'm currently pretty much over
  long distance bus travel, but it's the easiest way to see quite a bit of South
  America ...

  We didn't sleep well on the bus from Cusco. At least it got to our
  destination, Nazca, at the reasonable time of 8am. Predictably, we were
  accosted by droves of taxi drivers and tour operators when leaving the bus
  station, but managed to extricate ourselves and find a nice litle cafe for
  breakfast (where we were able to brush our teeth - luxury).

  After eating, we got a taxi to the airport to see the main (only?) thing
  people come there to see - the Nazca lines. We booked a 35-40 minute flight,
  then waited for about an hour, watching the overly-dramatic National
  Geographic documentary on the lines that must be on loop on the airport
  screens. It had been dusty earlier in the morning, preventing flights, but a
  few minutes after we signed up the first planes were allowed to take off.

  The flight was in a tiny plane with space for a pilot, co-pilot and six
  passengers. We spent a lot of the flight banking steeply to one side, then the
  other so that we could all get a look at the pictures (geoglyphs) below us.
  We saw plenty, of which the oft-repeated monkey/mono and hummingbird/colibri
  were the most impressive. We flew over the observation tower beside the
  highway that gives a view of three of the (less impressive) pictures, but the
  flight was definitely the best way to see them. According to the documentary
  in the airport, the current theory is that they were open-air temples for the
  Nazca people.

  The combination of a long bus journey, not much sleep, lasting sickness and a
  bumpy flight meant that weren't feeling the best once we got back on the
  ground, but it was worth it. Probably. It's one of the places I've wanted to
  see for ages, so it was good to do, but was a long time on a bus.

  Speaking of buses, after the flight we were taken back into town and promptly
  got on the next bus to Lima, leaving in 25 minutes and lasting another eight
  hours. Joy.

  The benefit of that bus was that we didn't have to stay in Nazca or get our
  second overnight bus in two days. Additionally, we got a decent dinner - pizza
  which hadn't been reheated in a bus microwave.

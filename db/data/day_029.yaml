  The main event for today was to visit the harrowing Choeung Ek Genocidal Centre
  - one of the killing fields during Pol Pot's regime. I doubt I could describe
  how awful and incomprehensible the history of the place is. Up to three million
  people died during the regime, out of a total population of eight million.
  Apparently, many of those who were executed were beaten to death because bullets
  were expensive.

  We didn't do too much in the afternoon, spending a bit of time during the
  journey back getting to grips with what we'd just seen and heard and how it had
  affected the country. We did small trip admin tasks - Rosie changed some of our
  leftover foreign currency, we booked tomorrow's bus and we wrote a mountain of
  postcards.

  Dinner was at a French restaurant Rosie had found the day before. The plan was
  to try somewhere upmarket and highly rated and hopefully have a fantastic meal.
  The food was good, but not as good as we were hoping. It was about as good as a
  decent restaurant in Edinburgh at almost the same price.

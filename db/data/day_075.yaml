  Today had an **early** start - 4.30am. Thankfully, our hotel provided us with
  breakfast and was happy to do so at 4.50am (prearranged), so we had a
  surprisingly tasty omelette and fruit.

 We had a full-day tour booked, starting at 5.30am in town, a 20 minute walk
  away. We arrived and waited a while, then were taken to the harbour to wait
  in our boat for more people. A little annoyed that we could have slept for
  longer, we waited for around half an hour for our long, thin boat to fill up
  with eventually ten other people. We had seats on one side of a thin table at
  the front, meaning people had to squeeze past us or the Japanese couple across
  from us to walk the length of the boat.
 
  Dawn came and went very quickly, then the boat chugged out of the packed
  harbour into the sea. We dozed as the (slow) boat spent maybe a couple of
  hours getting to Padar island, our first stop. This is a particularly
  picturesque island, full of sharp limestone peaks and surrounded by clear
  blue water and sheltered coves. We walked along a path up a hill (with plenty
  of other tourists) and enjoyed the view over the island and the others near
  by. <R> The views were lovely and the tourists started to peter out as we got 
  further up the mountain. </R>
 
  An hour or so later, our next stop was the island of Komodo to pay our park
  fees and see Komodo dragons, the largest lizards in the world. We went on a
  short walk to a man-made watering hole (currently turned off), where there
  were three adult male Komodos lying in wait for prey that comes to drink.
  Apparently it's a common hunting technique for them - appear asleep, then
  sprint at 20km an hour to kill deer or pigs (we saw both not too far away).
  They are impressive creatures, more than two metres long. I did feel sorry for
  the park rangers, however, spending day after day telling tourists not to get
  to close in case they get seriously injured ... <R> Mind you they do pretend 
  to be asleep and then sprint to catch their prey so I would also be very 
  cautious with anyone in my care. </R.
 
  We then took our boat to a beach near by with almost pink sand. The boat
  anchored maybe 50m out and we donned snorkeling gear before jumping into the
  water. Unfortunately, my mask fogged up within a minute no matter what I did
  to clean it, so I spent a lot of time with salt water in my eyes and a foggy
  mask. However, we did manage to see quite a few fish as we swam and dived.
 
  We were the last back to the boat which had already started moving when we got
  there. For some reason, we were told to swim to the back to hand up our fins,
  then swim/haul ourselves to the front of the boat while it was moving to get
  up the steps. Not particularly comfortable or necessary, as a crew member just
  brought our fins to the front of the boat when we got out.
 
  Our last stop was at manta point, where, you guessed it, we managed to see
  manta rays. At least one anyway. The boat slowed out to sea as the water
  became shallower and clear, maybe 15m deep. A member of the crew came up to
  the front, staring down into the water. After a few minutes, he pointed to the
  front right, shouting "There! Jump!". I caught a glimpse of a huge black ray
  seeming to flap its way through the water before rushing to get my snorkeling
  gear.
 
  We spent maybe half an hour with lots of people in the water swimming after a
  manta until it was lost, then holding onto the side of the boat while people
  on our boat and the other few near by searched for another manta, only to
  repeat the process. I didn't get a better look than that first glimpse,
  possibly because my mask was still fogging up. The look I got was great,
  though. <R> I got a pretty good view and they are just amazingly magnificant 
  creatures, the way they swim is just beautiful. </R>
 
  On the way home I warmed up and dried off on the roof of the boat, which, in
  retrospect probably wasn't my best decision of the trip. I'd made it this far
  without getting properly sunburnt shoulders - ah well. <R> To be fair Daniel 
  has managed 3 months in SEA without getting properly sunburnt, which given his 
  propensity to get sunburnt is pretty impresive. </R>

 We had some reasonable sushi for dinner, along with gnocchi that was better
 than the food from the Italian place the night before. We decided on how and
 where we wanted to go on the Gili islands, our next place, and booked most of
 that.

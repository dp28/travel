:entry: "\n(Today's post has a guest author: Rosie. Daniel cannot be held responsible
  for the accuracy of the\ninformation provided, and would actively question some
  of the opinions presented)\n\n<R>\n\nToday was to be an exciting day, we were heading
  off to the Thai island Koh Mak but first we needed\nto rectify a small issue of
  the day before, the fact that we still had the key to our hotel room in\nLuang Prabang,
  and for that we needed a post office. So we sent off into the town of Trat; before\ntea,
  before breakfast and accompanied by my ever present sniffles. I was what you might
  call grumpy,\nif you were brave enough. After finding the post office I left Daniel
  in search of the supermarket\nthat maps.me (great app)  informed me was right around
  the corner in an attempt to buy some tissues\nthat didn't feel like sand paper.
  After wandering aimlessly through aisle filled with 97 different\nbrands and varieties
  of washing powder (who needs that much choice) I found the single package of\ntissues
  and had to rush to pay for them before I sneezed again. I found Daniel back at the
  post\noffice and wandered back to the hotel where I had breakfast and a cup of tea
  and thus\nfelt like a new woman.\n\nThe songathew picked us up at the hotel and
  took us to the port where we learned that among other\nfellow riders we would be
  sharing the boat with a live chicken. Which was fortunately confined to a\nbox but
  occasionally left out a squawk of disapproval of such confinement. The first 50
  minutes of\nthe boat trip was relatively uneventful however the last 5 were wet,
  very wet. As we pulled into the\nharbour the heavens opened and as we got out, we
  and our stuff got very wet indeed. However by the\ntime the songathew had dropped
  us off at our hotel it has stopped raining all together. I believe\nthese downpours
  are reasonably common here but my goodness was it a lot of water!\n\nAfter a brief
  lunch where Dan ordered much better than me (annoying) we decided to go for a swim
  in\nthe sea. We donned swim suits and Daniel then announced as much to his own surprise
  as mine that he\ndidn't think he needed any sunscreen. This was in contrast to every
  day of the trip thus far where\nsunscreen has been liberally applied with a paint
  roller that he brought expressly for the purpose\nand which I am forbidden to touch
  (This is potentially a very slight exaggeration).\n\nThe sea was lovely and warm
  and surprisingly salty (I know, I know, but you forget these things)\nhowever the
  shower afterward was fresh and surprisingly cold so maybe things are different here.\nAfter
  showers we sat on the beach for an hour or two reading (and programming) and trying
  to\nconvince the puppies that live at this hotel to play with me, there are four
  and they are adorable!!\nAfter a time it became happy hour however upon approaching
  the bar we were informed that the man who\nmade the cocktails was out fishing so
  we would have to wait. He came in later with one very small\nfish but he looked
  very proud of himself and thus my mojito was not missed in vain.  By the time he\ngot
  back however it was time to search for dinner and so we headed off towards the major
  town to a\nrestaurant called Table Tales.\n\nThe food was great, and I got a mojito
  \U0001F60A. We started with chicken satay and then I had scallops\nwhich were perfectly
  done and covered in garlic butter and Dan had a masaman curry which\nunfortunately
  was a little bit sweet, even for Dan (I know) but the roti that came with it was\ngreat.
  We headed back to the hotel, opting for roads this time rather than the jungle trails
  were\nhad used to get to dinner. After admiring the moon over the water (and reading/programming)
  for an\nhour or so we headed to bed.\n\n</R>\n"

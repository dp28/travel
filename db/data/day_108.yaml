  <R>
  Today's post is written by a ghost who I'm 90% sure does not read the blog
  but is none the less an active supporter of RnD travels. It covers our entire
  time in Chile but focuses on today.
  </R>

  For the Chilean section of our travels, we signed up with McJack’s Pretty Good
  Adventures Tour group. They are a pretty small operation specializing in bespoke
  itineraries. I feel we have to rate them pretty highly, importantly their rates are very
  competitive, and secondly they are Rosie’s parents, and even though I am fairly sure they
  don’t read this blog, they just might.

  Within 24 hours in Santiago we had enjoyed a good meal and more than 12 varietals of wine,
  don’t worry they were all locally sourced. Some were good, some were excellent,
  while they all tasted like wine other flavors that were mentioned, (raspberries, peaches,
  vanilla, tobacco and others) however none of us were able to catch the hints of dusty roads
  and sweaty horses so often found in wines from the neighboring Argentinean region of Malbec. The
  favoured wine of the week, we checked for consistency by testing several bottles
  over the course of several days, was a Sauvignon Blanc from Matetic Viña, not only
  does it have a pale bright color with green hues, an intense mineral and herbal nose,
  it is full of citrus aromas. The plate is fresh and juicy with good acidity, volume and a
  long elegant finish; it also has a really cool label.

  Santiago is a very large sprawling city with many hills, having visited the museum of
  Memory and Human Rights (a sad but compelling catalogue of events from the time
  of the Pinocet dictatorship) and a few of the sites around Bellavista and Cerro San
  Cristobel our phone had clocked 9.1 miles an 69 flights of stairs.

  The coastal town of Valparaiso, about 2 hour drive from Santiago is a curious town
  consisting of 45 cerros (hills) that surround a shipping port, each hill forms a
  distinct community, many in the old town are tiny, very steep the easiest way to get
  from one to another is by using the 100 year old funicular system. Street
  artists brightly and intensely decorate the ramshackle and slightly run down streets.
  While many are political, there is in general a light air to most of the murals think
  Banks without the attitude.

  We greatly enjoyed a visit to the restored museum and former home of Chili’s most
  famous poet Pablo Neruda in Valparaiso, judging by the eclectic style in which it is
  decorated I can’t help feeling he would have greatly enjoyed the street art that can
  now be seen from his quirky home.

  All McJack’s nearly good adventures involve a walk, it is usually the signature event
  of their trips and this one was only different in the sense that it seemed it was going
  to be rather modest: A 3-4 kilometer walk with a 1000m gain. What could possibly
  go wrong? The only anticipated problem was the altitude, but what’s 5,550 meters
  (18,000 feet) when you are with friends.

  All started off well, and just so you are not worried, ended well. Some of the bits
  in the middle, however, were a little suspect. The day started with a sound breakfast at which
  Dan and Michael slipped a small supply of cakes and biscuits into their pockets.
  2 Litres of water per person - check. Factor 55, 75, 100 suncreen - check.
  Empanadas - check. Down loaded maps - check. There are 2 routes to Lascar Volcano,
  let’s just say for reasons that were never clear we took the route less travelled.
  We turned off the main road and were bumping along a bumpy but passable track,
  we had a 4 wheel drive and were happy to make us of it.

  Shortly after leaving the main road we needed to do a little bit road building, we
  threw a few rocks into a small gulley and we were quickly back on the bumpy but
  passable track. Then we turned a corner to find that the track had deteriorated into
  a very narrow steep ledge, rocks on one side, rocks the ground, no rocks on the
  other side just rather a lot of air and a rather steep drop. Rosie got out to clear a few
  rocks from the road. Michael, the driver, got out and said “well what do you think
  guys, can we make it down there?” Clare and Dan got out, we don’t know whether
  they were thinking they could help guide the car down the very narrow and steep
  ledge, whether it would be better if someone was available to go for help if the car
  slid and rolled over and landed upside in the valley below. Or maybe they just didn’t
  want to be in the car if it slid and rolled over and landed upside in the valley below.
  No one said it out loud but more than one of us calculated that from the top portion
  the car could perhaps flip fully over and roll back upside right, from lower down the
  slope it would probably only have enough height to roll over onto the roof. One
  thing that was said, once Michael had skillfully and gingerly negotiated the car down
  the slope, there was no way, as in no way, to get back up. On this we were all
  agreed.

  For the next few kilometers, they felt like miles, we bumped along without a
  problem, we passed an abandoned car, and as we crossed onto the shoulder of
  Lascar Volcano, we could see car tracks heading towards the place we planned to
  start hiking. Even better than car tracks, we saw a moving car heading in the same
  direction as us. As we drove higher up the volcano side it got steeper and Michael
  swapped back down to 4 wheel drive, gradually the car got slower, and slower and
  then it had no power, we could hear the engine, we could see the see the lights but
  the car had no power. "Oh well" said Clare "we can walk from here". When got out, the
  altimeter read above 16,000 feet. At this altitude the effective oxygen concentration
  is ~10% this may explain both Clare’s devil may care attitude and the fact that the
  diesel powered car we were driving had given up the ghost.

  Having driven to 16,300 feet it was mere 2,000 feet gain to get to the crater. That’s
  the equivalent of parking on the glaciar at Kilimanjaro and then wandering a couple of km
  to the summit. Not so fast my friend, and that’s exactly how we hiked to the caldera,
  not so fast my friend. Slowly, slowly, we reached the edge of the enormous
  sulphurous carter I will let the pictures speak for the view. As we
  surveyed the scene, took photos and savoured the moment we each noticed that the
  others were a behaving a bit odd, nothing dramatic just a bit dopey or clumsey and
  definitely getting a bit to close to the edge, the funny thing is I felt fine and didn’t
  understand why the others thought I was a getting too close the edge. I think
  perhaps the combination of low oxygen and high sulphur gases was messing with
  their minds.

  The descent was surprising difficult but we were soon back at the car which started
  no problems, gaining power as we descended, and we speed along the path more
  traveled back to the main road. As we headed back to San Pedro to Atacama we
  stopped to pick up a hitch-hicker, an articulate young woman who had been out
  rock climbing for the day. She is a local adventure tour guide and provided us with
  lots of information about interesting places we could go and things we could see. We
  told her that we had been to Lascar for day, she smiled knowingly and we thought it
  was a smile of approval signifying that she was impressed that we had navigated
  the route and successfully slogged our way to the top without a local guide. We
  chatted along, we discussed the crowds of tourists that collect at certain times of day
  at certain sites. We remarked on how isolated and alone we were at Lascar, just
  before we dropped her off, our friendly local guide casually told us that there were
  no tourists at Lascar at the moment because it had experienced an increase in
  signature warning events and that the government had closed access and that a 5km
  ring around the carter was restricted. I can’t imagine how we missed volcano alert
  system from our check list. Nor what those other fools where doing on ths side of an
  active volacano.

  <R>
  For those that are unaware, while this may sound like a particuarly bizzare
  adventure, it is fairly normal occurance when travling with McJacks pretty good
  adventures. We received free passage on this adventure for our honest opinion,
  however in the interest of keeping the peace I shall let you make up your own
  mind.

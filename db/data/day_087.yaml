  We had an earlier morning, up at 7.15am, to catch a train out of the city to
  the Blue Mountains for the day. The Blue mountains are two hours (and, due to
  discounts, about Â£1.50/$2) from Sydney and apparently sometimes look blue due
  to the eucalyptus forests that cover the area.

  We met Marianne at Central Staion along with Tara and Callum, friends from St
  Andrews we'd met up with earlier in Thailand who're now working in Sydney. The
  train journey passed quickly and with a smattering of familiar place names
  reused in Australia (eg Penrith). We got off in Katoomba, a bit higher and
  colder than Sydney and unfortunately covered in clouds.

  Marianne knew a great gingerbread cafe in a converted church, which, once we
  arrived, hadn't actully opened. This gave us a chance to buy some lunch at the
  Aldi up the road (no Lidl in evidence), enabling us to get a bit of goats'
  cheese while we could. Back at the gingerbread cafe, I loaded up on chocolate
  with a hazelnut hot chocolate and a salted caramel chocolate cake that pretty
  much set me up for the rest of the day.

  We walked through the town to a viewpoint where the clouds were just clearing
  enough to make out the outlines of some impressive cliff faces near by. We
  walked down a pretty packed path to three huge rock pillars called the three
  sisters. As we did so, the cloud lifted a little, giving us stunning views
  across the forest hundreds of metres below. The path was thin, the tourists
  were plentiful and the drops were pretty sharp, but the handrails were good.

  Back up at the viewpoint we got a much better look at the landscape which was
  breathtaking. We took another path and very quickly got away from the bustle
  of the viewpoint, but with multiple points with possibly better views. It
  became crowded again near a waterfall and the skytrain station (a pretty big
  one-carriage horizontal cable car over a gorge), but the views were worth it.
  They could maybe do with a couple of ziplines, but so could Sydney to be
  honest.

  We had our packed lunch at a picnic bench in a small park. It was lucky that
  the day hadn't warmed up that much, meaning our goats' cheese was still good
  for dipping our crackers into. Afterwards, we made our way back into town to
  the train, arriving just in time.

  Back in Sydney, we found an open bar/restaurant close to where we were staying
  and Tara and Callum live. Slightly more places were open today than yesterday,
  but a lot were closed - it feels kind of like Ireland. We all got pizza and
  sebago and sweet potato chips without really knowing what sebago was - turns
  out it's a popular variety of potato here (which made great chips / roasties).

  Back at our Airbnb, I phoned home, which is a little more awkward here due to
  the time difference. We're here during one of the few weeks a year that it's
  ten hours between the UK and Sydney - due to the two daylight savings' times,
  last week it was a difference of eleven hours, tomorrow it will be a
  difference of nine hours. That also means that this year I miss the "spring
  forward" clock change and instead get two "fall back" mornings. I wish it was
  like that every time ...

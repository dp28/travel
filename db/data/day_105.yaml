  Despite the fact that it was offered, I resisted the temptation of lemon
  meringue pie for breakfast, opting for yoghurt and muesli instead.

  After breakfast we drove out of town to one of the salt flats around an hour
  away. As we approached, the cry, desert landscape suddenly was covered in
  green scrub before giving way to a barren, white landscape. Near where we
  parked was a shallow brine lake with quite a few birds including several
  species of flamingoes. We walked alongside the lake, taking pictures of the
  birds and occasionally the tiny white lizards that weren't afraid of us at
  all.

  We continued into the desert, stopping further down the salt flats to have a
  bit of a walk and saw several wild mules or donkeys along with evidence of
  something burrowing into the sand.

  We drove on towards the mountains, stopping at a small village for a lunch of
  soup. We drove higher, probably reaching over 4,000 metres, stopping at a pair
  of lagoons. We could definitely feel the altitude, making it necessary to
  breathe more deeply. We saw quite a few vicuna, like llamas but thinner and
  not domesticated. What they were eating was hard to determine - they seemed to
  avoid the clumps of grass and found something edible in the gravel.

  Driving back down we saw a lot more than on the way up. We saw red-tinged
  cacti that we'd missed before and a big group of ostrich-like rhea walking
  through them. Near by, we saw a desert fox and its cub, not shy of our car at
  all. We stopped for a walk in a canyon before the village we'd had lunch
  where Rosie got a few great shots of a falcon, then we got a brief sighting of
  a condor on the way back to the tower.

  The drive back was long, allowing us to fully appreciate the scale of the
  desert. The slope down from the mountains was gradual, leading onto a massive
  plain bounded only on the horizon by another set of mountains. We stopped at
  the salt flats where we'd seen flamingoes to catch the incredible sunset on
  the brine lake.

  We had a great dinner where I tried a Chilean cocktail that I wouldn't really
  recommend - a terremoto or "earthquake". It consists of bad, cheap browny
  white wine (sold in 5 litre bottles) with pineapple ice cream and fernet.
  Sweet, sickly and pretty weird.

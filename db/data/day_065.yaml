  We'd stayed close to Sentral station last night so that we could get an early
  bus for our morning flight today. Both a little under the weather, we caught a
  bus around 7.30am to the airport, then got a very short flight to Singapore.

  We got a bus into the centre and walked slightly outside of it to get to our
  hotel in Little India. Both fairly hungry, we headed out to find nearby cheap
  lunch.

  Singapore is significantly more expensive than everywhere we've been so far.
  For example, our accommodation, which is reasonable but not fantastic, is
  about $70 (about £50) a night. Our next accommodation, in Indonesia, will be
  $7 (£5) per night, although admittedly a bit more rough and ready. Even our
  fancier hotel in Bangkok was less at $60 (£45) and included breakfast.

  All of this means we were somewhat more reserved when spending in Singapore.
  Luckily, there is plenty of pretty cheap food available at hawker food courts.
  These used to be street vendors, but were moved into purpose-built food
  centres by the government. They're great and have a wide range of food. The
  one closest to us had, unsurprisingly, a large range of Indian food, so we
  both ended up with types of stuffed flat bread - Rosie had a chicken naan
  while I had a banana prata (kind of like a stuffed, recooked crepe).

  In the afternoon, we planned our few days in Singapore, then caught the
  subway to Mount Faber. "Mount" seems like a bit of an exaggeration - it may
  be Singapore's third highest hill, but it's only just over 100m. That amount
  of elevation was enough to give us a decent view of the sunset on one side
  and the city centre on the other. Many of the taller buildings are taller than
  the hill - some twice as high.

  We slowly made our way back towards our hotel, learning that even if Maps.Me
  shows a path in a park, that doesn't mean the path is accessible. We stopped
  off at a mall, another location for a wide range of cheap food. We got a
  mixture of Chinese and Indian foods (I'm pretty sure the orange chicken was
  better than Rosie's favourite Panda Express version).

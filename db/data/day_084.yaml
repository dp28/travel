  After half a night of patchy sleep, we woke up before landing in Sydney -
  three hours ahead, a new country and continent for me and also the furthest
  south I've been so far.

  Australia's customs process is notoriously strict, so we decided to declare a
  small wooded souvenir we had purchased. It turns out this was a good idea -
  the customs official was very friendly, let us keep the souvenir, gave us tips
  about Sydney and let us on our way. There was no line, so it was all very
  quick. The other people around us had opted for the "Nothing to declare"
  queue, which was significantly longer as people were being randomly searched.

  Probably our first mistake here was withdrawing money. We've been in cash
  economies for the last three months, so it felt wrong not to have at least a
  little cash. Four days later and we have paid for everything by contactless
  unless we remember we have A$100 in cash we need to spend ...

  Our flight had arrived at 7am and we got through the airport quicker than
  expected. The airport isn't too far from the city, so we arrived at our Airbnb
  too early to get in. We took the opportunity to get some breakfast, then had a
  brief one hour nap once we could get into our private room in the shared
  house.

  The main reason we had for coming to Sydney was to see Marianne, a friend from
  Sallies who's just started a PhD here. After our nap, we met Marianne at a
  cafe close by for some great food (Rosie's been missing bread in particular)
  and caught up. After eating, we decided to see the city centre sights, so took
  the train to Circular Quay. There, we took in the sites of the Harbour Bridge,
  the Opera House and the massive cruise ship moored between them. We walked
  around, finishing at the Opera House where we said goodbye to Marianne and
  went into the botanical gardens.

  We spent a while in the botanics, walking around the succulent garden and
  using the free garden wifi. I had a carrot cake at the cafe and we sat on the
  grass outside for a while as Rosie wasn't feeling that great. We saw several
  parrot-like birds while we were there and plenty of ibis and, on our way out,
  got a good view of a cookabarra.

  We walked back to the Harbour Bridge and, with a bit of searching, found our
  way up to walk across it. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be that many
  decent-looking places to eat there, so we got the train back to Redfern,
  seeing the sunset from the Harbour Bridge.

  It turned out that not that many places were open and those that were open
  were just as expensive as where we had been. I guess we were a little too used
  to cheap South East Asian prices. We ended up at a slightly upmarket
  French-inspired place with a set two-course meal. Rosie got a starter and I
  got a dessert (creme brulee) and for once we got the same main (gorgonzola
  gnocchi - we've been missing cheese) due to he reduced meal selection. It was
  great and came with a glass of wine of which surprisingly few of the options
  were Australian.

  When we left it was actually a little cold, which was somewhat novel. We also
  got shouted at by a guy on the street and realised that since leaving the UK
  we haven't really seen any public drunkenness until now. We stopped at an
  unnecessarily air-conditioned Spar to get some bread, butter and bananas for
  breakfasts. I also got a Dairy Milk - unsurprisingly, not as good as the UK
  version, never mind Irish, but a chunk is still goodn shaved into a toasted
  banana sandwich.

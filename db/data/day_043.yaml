  We both woke up a bit sick today. Rosie's been sick on and off for the last four
  weeks - apparently it's spreading. Either that or it's smog-related - we met a
  few people who said they got sore throats after arriving in Hanoi. Or I could
  be allergic to early mornings as I got up at 6.30am to try and find breakfast
  (and returned empty handed - sadly the rotiboy place wasn't open).

  We had an early-ish flight to Ho Chi Minh City, so got a taxi to the airport.
  As we weren't leaving the country it was a pretty smooth experience. Transport
  from the airport, however, was not. It's Tet tomorrow, so lots of things may or
  may not be open or running. The taxi drivers, unsurprisingly, were insistent
  that the buses weren't running. They, however, are pretty notorious for scamming
  tourists and we were reluctant to believe them. There didn't seem to be many
  buses around, but Rosie asked an official who then called a bus company who said
  they were running. After about 30 minutes we saw a bus and waved to hail it. The
  driver waved back and drove on. Sigh. We waited for another 20 minutes, then
  gave up and got an Uber.

  It was lucky we ended up in an Uber as our hotel turned out to be in a maze of
  alleyways off one of the main backpacker party streets. If he hadn't called the
  hotel to get directions, it would have taken us ages to find.

  Once we got there we ended up waiting along with another guy for our rooms to be
  cleaned. He was originally Vietnamese, but lived in Seattle. <R> He was really
  interesting to talk to and told us all about his life. It was almost like getting
  a locals perspective on Vietnam although he has lived most of his life in the west
  so I imagined that coloured his view of the country he told us what his family
  thought about Communism, Americans, and where the country was headed. </R> I was pretty hungry
  by the time we got into our room, so we dropped off our bags and headed out to
  get something to eat.

  We chose somewhere nearby and ordered more of the caramelized pork cooked in a
  clay pot. Pretty soon after ordering, a drunken English expat butted into our
  conversation. He was with a (sober) Irish expat, who was clearly embarrassed by
  his friend and jumped into the conversation as damage control after a few
  boorish comments from the first guy. We had an odd meal, learning bits about
  expat life in Vietnam from the Irish guy with occasional drunken additions from
  the English guy, eg claiming he fought in the Vietnam war (which was immediately
  refuted by the Irish guy). <R> I did not like the English guy and decided fairly
  early on that he didn't like me either (apparently because I said ya instead of yes).
  He even told Daniel that he shouldn't date me, what a guy.

  Slightly bemused, we went back to our hotel to try and plan what to do in
  Malaysia, which is still a bit up in the air. We ended up with enough of a plan
  to book flights, but were defeated by Air Asia's website refusing to cooperate.

  Today was the last day of the lunar year, so while we had dinner at a small
  restaurant several people playing a drum and dancing in a dragon costume came
  through the alley outside multiple times. Around 11pm, we made our way to a
  bridge to see the New Year fireworks display. We were in a large crowd of people
  and scooters (of course), but managed to get a spot with a decent view. There
  was a spectacular display at midnight for a good 15 minutes, accompanied by
  various members of the crowd lighting sparkler cannons and giant, metre-long
  party poppers filled with bits of golden foil. Spectacular, but there was a huge
  amount of rubbish on the ground as we made our way back to the hotel.

  Happy year of the dog!

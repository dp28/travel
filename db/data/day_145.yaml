  Another early morning to get promptly picked up by a bus at 5.15am. We tried,
  not particularly successfully, to get a bit more sleep, then found ourselves
  at the same village and restaurant as yesterday for breakfast.

  We started to get to know our group: two American guys who worked as
  programmers, two American women, a British couple in the last month of a
  9-month trip, and a Polish guy in Peru for a month or two.

  We had a long drive up a road with many, many switchbacks beside Peru's
  highest mountain, Huascaran. We reached the highest point of our trek (4,767m)
  while in the car, then slowly made our way down into a valley.

  We started our walkÂ from a small village, with bits of gradual up and down. It
  was a relatively easy four hours' walk, but slow. That was probably good, as
  some of the others hadn't been at altitude for that long and one guy had had
  some unpleasant altitude sickness symptoms. The scenery, however, was stunning
  as we are surrounded by jagged peaks, some of which are snow-capped.

  At camp we had our obligatory tea and popcorn, then introduced the group to
  the version of President that we played on or previous trek. Unfortunately,
  one of the American guys went straight to his tent to sleep rather than eat
  dinner as he was sick.

  There was a full moon that night, so torches weren't really needed. The
  glacier above us even seemed to glow as we got into our tent.

  The tents themselves were decent - dome tents with entrances on two sides,
  plenty of space and a good porch. Most of all, they were warm and it was
  **cold** at 3,800m. The sleeping bags, too, were very warm - especially as
  there wasn't much room to move inside them and a drawstring to pull the neck
  closed tight.

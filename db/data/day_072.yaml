  Having not slept particularly well the night before and having a really good
  bed last night, we had a bit of a lie in this morning. When we got up and made
  our way to the kitchen we were gretted by Denise who'd got a late flight the
  night before from Jakarta. We chatted over breakfast and for some of the
  morning, then went down into Ubud.

  We had a great lunch at a primarily vegetarian restaurant, then followed a
  ridge walk on the other side of town for the early afternoon. By the time we
  made it back to the centre, people were starting to gather for the night's
  festivities. <R> The walk was beautiful, with lovely views of a jungle and of
  some rice paddies. </R>

  Tomorrow is Nyepi, Balinese Hindu New Year. As part of that, on the day before
  Nyepi (today), people in Balinese towns parade giant, demonic effigies called
  ogoh-ogoh through their towns in the evening to drive out all of the evil
  spirits. Tomorrow, the entire island of four million people will shut down,
  with no travel and very little noise or light, so that the evil spirits pass
  over the island. <R> It is very impressive that they can shut down an entire
  island including the airport. They also shut off the internet. </R>

  We had a snack dinner at a restaurant recommended by Denise very close by to
  the area the ogoh-ogoh were going to gather at. After eating, we joined the
  crowds lining the streets as they began to arrive. They're all sorts of
  shapes and sizes, primarily twisted, partly-human figures, but not always.
  They're made from foam and cloth, presumably with a wire or bamboo frame,
  sometimes with coloured electic lights set into them or their frame to shine
  onto them. They're supported on large lattices of bamboo poles, creating
  squares up to 8x8 or 9x9 with groups of men, women or children carrying them,
  one person per bamboo cell and the effigy taking up the centre. All in all,
  it's reminiscent of a St Patrick's Day parade (which is tomorrow), but held at
  night and somehow combined with Halloween. <R> And also louder and more chaotic. </R>

  Once they had all arrived in a large, open field, we (along with thousands of
  others) moved between them, looking at them more closely and taking photos.
  Many had their own strangely-coloured light sources and one even had an
  in-built smoke machine.

  After a while, a torch-lit procession began to lead them all back up the
  street to the centre of town. The larger ogoh-ogoh were so tall that they
  would have become entangled in the overhead electrical wires, so had to have
  men with long bamboo poles to lift the wires out of the way while the
  procession passed. This just added to the general mayhem of the day - around
  fifty people shouting as they carried the ogoh-ogoh, with others shouting to
  stop them before they entangled with the wires, then to go when the wires were
  lifted, with thousands of people on the street and bands of drummers and
  cymbalists(?) adding to the general racket. <R> It was somewhere between hilarious
  and very impressive, particuarly as the larger ogoh-ogoh looked very heavy and
  the men carrying them looked exhasuted by the end of the night. However some
  of the smaller ogoh-ogoh were carried by children who appeared to be having
  the time of their lives. </R>

  The crossroads at the centre was heaving, but we managed to get a place on the
  street with an ok view (gradually getting better as we made our way to the
  front). It turned out the ogoh-ogoh were from four or five different groups
  who then took it in turns to put on a show in the street, with music and
  dancers, followed by the ogoh-ogoh. Large groups of people would carry the
  ogoh-ogoh, moving them up and down, spinning around and running up the street
  as the tightly-packed crowd quickly backed up (I only fell over once in the
  throng). The aim seemed partly to be to shake the effigies so hard that they
  broke - the crowd shouted the loudest when one of the wolf-men broke in half
  and when one of the hag-like female ogoh-ogoh lost her head.

  The original processions started around 6pm, but these performances didn't end
  until well after 11pm. It was a pretty hectic evening and by the time we were
  back at Denise's we were ready for the relaxed day ahead.

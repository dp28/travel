  <R> The forecast for today was supposed to be very very wet in the afternoon.
  As such we got up fairly early and went to have breakfast. TripAdvisor had
  suggested that the pancakes at a street food stall run by a hearing-impaired
  couple were very good so we wandered over there to check them out.  I had a
  strawberry and Daniel had banana (surprising, I thought Daniel didn’t like
  bananas). The pancakes were good and the woman was very nice, even teaching us
  some sign language however the one disappointment was the tea. Thus far in South
  East Asia I have ordered my tea black, however yesterday when I had ordered tea
  it had come with a little jug of milk and so I thought that ordering tea with
  milk would be safe in the Cameron Highlands. Not so, my tea with milk was 4/5th
  tea and a full 1/5th condensed milk, I was sad.

  After breakfast we packed a bag with waterproofs (just in case) and headed over
  to the taxi rank to get a taxi to one of the closer tea plantations called the
  Cameron valley plantation. On the way we saw some spectacular views of tea
  plantations with patches of dark green and light green leaves where the tea had
  been harvested and not yet been harvested respectively. At the tea plantation
  we ordered some of their tea to drink (it had to be done) in part to make up for
  the breakfast tea however I was sorely disappointed yet again. Instead of a pot
  with tea leaves or even a tea bag we were served tea that had been made probably
  20 minutes ago and had been standing at just below boiling for the last 20
  minutes. As such it tasted slightly stale and overly bitter, it was most similar
  to the type of tea they serve at conferences where the plenary lecture over ran
  by 10 minutes.

  However, the view from the tea shop was fantastic and we even saw a hawk
  wheeling about above the fields of tea before it was mobbed by a crow (Chapter
  6 - Talons and Tea Leaves). The plan was to walk back to town first through the
  tea plantations and then up through the jungle paths. We set of and soon
  realized that the Cameron Highlands are hilly, very hilly. As such the people
  have terraced every spare acre not planted with tea (which does not need to be
  terraced) and planted an extreme variety of fruits and vegetables. We walked
  through fields of beans, peas, cabbages and some vines with a type of gourd
  looking thing on them which neither of us recognized.

  When we were far enough away from the tea plantations so as not get told off,
  Daniel decided to get out his drone and see if he could get any good shots of
  the terraces. We spent about 10 minutes playing around with the drone but
  unfortunately the wind was too strong, the hill too steep, and we were too
  useless to be able to get any decent shots. We carried on up the hill as the
  terraces turned to jungle and the sky turned to cloud and then we were in the
  cloud and in the jungle. We continued upwards and forwards along what we were
  90% sure was the path although we had to do a fair amount of bush whacking and
  many of these bushes whacked back. The path got very steep at points, to the
  point that we had to give each other a boost up, but was always manageable and
  we were very glad that it was not raining.

  Along the path we saw many pitcher plants which looked very cool as well as an
  enormous stag beetle the body of which was probably the same size as a salt
  shaker (like the type you would find in a canteen) but with legs and horns. We
  got to the top of the hill (by going up, and up some more) and then headed back
  down along a much better path towards the town. When we were about 30 minutes
  from the hotel the promised rain started and we barely had time to get
  waterproofs on before the heavens really opened. The path turned into a small
  river and we squelched our way down it getting to a tarmac road just as the rain
  stopped. Everything not covered by the coat was soaking by the time the rain
  stopped less than 15 minutes later.

  Despite now being very very wet we were also very very hungry and so went in
  search of lunch where I sampled some Malaysian Guinness, apparently it’s the
  best Guinness in the world after Ireland. I thought it was good but a bit
  strong. After lunch we headed back to the hotel to shower and try and dry our
  clothes. It's difficult to dry anything in a room that is only just big enough
  to hold two beds and two people especially when quite a lot of Daniel's stuff
  was still wet from yesterday but we did our best. After showers Daniel worked
  on the website a bit and then we went for dinner and tried to get a somewhat
  early night. </R>

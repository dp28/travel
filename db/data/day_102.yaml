  After another massive breakfast (I was prepared this time), we headed for the
  Museum of Precolumbian Art. There were examples of arts and crafts created by
  many of the peoples from all over Latin America before European influence,
  with a specific exhibition on the Atacama and on Chile (including Easter
  island). For me, one of the most interesting pieces was an Incan form of
  storing information by connecting many cords together and tying knots in them
  in particular places.

  We then picked up a car which Michael and Clare had rented and had a seafood
  lunch, before driving out of the city and up into the mountains in search of a
  walk. We ended up in a kind of resort campsite that did have walks available,
  but they were over a bridge that shut shortly before we arrived. There wasn't
  much evidence of any easily accessible trails or paths nearby, so we walked
  through the campsite and down to the river, then back up. On the drive back we
  did get to see a brilliant sunset down the bottom of the valley.

  We had some more Peruvian food for dinner with gigantic portions. I had rice
  and beans covered with a slab of steak and accompanied by plaintain and an
  oniony salad. It barely looked like I had eaten any by the time I had to give
  up. We shared a starter with quite a few different dishes including a
  bizarre pink salt that was close to eating a little bit of bleach or ammonia.
  The Chilean Merlot, however, was great.

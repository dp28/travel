  This was the longest day of our trek and also the highest point. We were
  wakened at 5am by one of the porters offering us coca tea to help with the
  altitude. We packed up our stuff and had a warm breakfast (potatoes, sausages,
  cake, jam, tea, hot chocolate).

  The morning was spent walking up the valley along with the various other
  groups on the same trek. We were occassionally passed by teams of horses as we
  took our time with the altitude. The views were stunning and it was good to
  chat with the other members of the group. The only negative was that I learnt
  that trying to find the most discrete place to go to the toilet on a popular
  hiking trail inevitably means finding an unpleasant mess.

  With the help of a few snacks we made it up to Salkantay Pass, the saddle
  below the huge, snow-covered Salkantay mountain, rising another 1,500m above
  us. We had more coca tea and cheese (queso fresco, sadly) sandwich and took a
  lot of photos. All downhill from there onwards.

  We had lunch several hours later after spotting a condor in the clouds high
  above us. It was another great meal and an enjoyable break from walking.

  After lunch it was on down the valley. The environment very quickly changed
  from just grass with the occassional flowers low to the ground and views of
  snow to a warmer cloud forest teeming with life. Jose told us this was
  essentially the upper part of the Amazon rainforest. The lower we went the
  larger the trees became, the wider the variety of colours of flowers and the
  more insects and hummingbirds became visible. The snowcaps were soon lost to
  sight, hidden by clouds above us. By the end of the walk there were some
  stunning swaths of bright yellow flowers on both sides of the valley.

  We finished the walk at an altitude of around 2,900m and the entire group was
  only about 20 minutes apart from first to last. We had another decent meal
  and a smaller group of us stayed up for a bit chatting and laughing, buoyed up
  by our day's achievement and the relative luxury of being able to lie in until
  6am tomorrow.

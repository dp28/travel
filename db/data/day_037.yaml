  We started off this morning with a bit more booking stuff and starting to catch
  up on diary entries. We wandered around the Old Quarter, booking a water puppet
  show for the evening.

  We walked out of the Old Quarter to get to Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum. Almost in
  reaction to the tangle that is the Old Quarter, the streets elsewhere are really
  wide and lined with trees. According to our guide from the day before they were
  built by the French. The mausoleum was imposing, but relatively simple and
  unadorned. We sat outside and happened to see the changing of the guard,
  complete with the slightly ridiculous march that seems to be compulsory for
  guard soldiers outside large public buildings the world over. <R> It was made
  even more entertaining by the fact that while 3 of the guards did the funny march
  a fourth stood off to the side in full dress uniform totally not to attention and
  just aimlessly wandering around. </R>

  We went back to the Old Quarter for lunch (can't get enough of those roast pork
  banh mi). It was a great choice - we stumbled across a Japanese cream puff
  pastry shop with brilliant vanilla cream that they'd inject into your choice of
  pastry.

  The only thing we had left to book was transport to and from the few places we
  are planning on going. We walked to a couple of travel offices to do this
  (saving some money) and decided to change our self-guided trip to Mai Chau to be
  completely through a tour operator. Hopefully it'll be better than in Chiang Mai
  as the tour operator has a lot of very good reviews.

  We spent a while shopping in the various markets filled with silk and
  counterfeit branded clothes. After exercising my very rudimentary haggling
  skills, I ended up with a "North Face" soft shell jacket for $15, which will be
  useful in Vietnam and South America (assuming it lasts). Unfortunately, Rosie
  didn't see anything she liked, but we'll be back.

  One of the main things to do in Hanoi apparently is to go to a water puppet
  show. The theatre has a large pool of water on the stage with several screens
  blocking view to the back of the stage, with musicians in the wings. Puppeteers
  control large puppets in front of the stage using large poles under the water.
  There were 14 small sketches, some impressive, some comical. One old the story
  of the tortoise lake in Hanoi, where a golden tortoise appeared to take back
  a god-given sword from an ancient Vietnamese hero. The most impressive
  performance was the dragon dance, where dragon puppets shot water and fireworks
  from their mouths as they dipped in and out of the water.

  We walked back to the hotel through the weekend night market. We had some
  delicious street food (deep fried noodles and beef) on the recommendation of
  tomorrow's tour operator, finished off a few diary entries and got some sleep.

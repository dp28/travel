  We had a pretty lazy day today, getting up late and going for brunch at a
  sandwich place that had only taken a couple of days off for Tet. We spent the
  afternoon in a large park with impressive flower displays (and some fish in
  tanks?). Unfortunately, similar to yesterday's lunch, attempted to find
  somewhere decent for dinner, were thwarted by Tet opening times and ended up
  somewhere a bit disappointing for the price.

  As we walked through the city throughout the day we encountered various different
  groups of people involved in, presumably, Tet-related celebrations. While trying
  to find dinner we found ourselves in a large crowd of people milling around in a
  big square - I'm not really sure what was going on. On our way back from dinner
  we went into an outdoor performance area where someone was singing in Vietnamese
  accompanied by four dancers, then was replaced by a dancing troupe singing &
  dancing to "If you're happy and you know it clap your hands" in Vietnamese. All
  the children in the audience were called up beforehand and given basic dance
  moves to do as well.

  The best performance we stumbled across was a group of men playing music,
  particularly drums, while holding up a bamboo pole about seven metres high with
  a small bar as a foothold just below the top. Another man in a dragon costume
  climbed the pole and proceeded to dance to the music. Towards the end none of
  his hands or feet were on the pole - he spun himself around, balancing his chest
  on the top of the pole. He did this while wearing a massive dragon costume
  which covered his head and dangled below his feet.

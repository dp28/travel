  Like on the Salkantay trek, we were woken up by a guide giving us coca tea.
  However, this was at 6am, practically a lie in. At least, it was for me - I
  don't think anyone else slept particularly well.

  Today's walk wasn't that long, but did have almost 1,000m of ascent up to a
  pass at 4,650m, the highest point we'd walk to. It was a slow walk as the two
  American guys were both sick and had some altitude sickness symptoms. To make
  it worse for them, one of them sprained his ankle early on in the climb.

  We made our way up to the pass, stopping frequently so we could regroup. Our
  guides had provided snack bags, which were very welcome: some chocolate, some
  sweets and a bit of fruit all in a drawstring bag, refilled every morning -
  possibly the best part of the trek, definitely the best bit organised by the
  company.

  Eventually, the group split apart, so we got to the pass at different times.
  We took some photos and had lunch (stuffed peppers carried by the guides), but
  soon left as it began to snow/rain.

  The campsite was only a couple of hours down the path, meaning we slept at
  4,200m, even colder than the night before. We played President again, then a
  few hands of beanie with a subset of the group - neither of the American guys
  appeared at dinner and the American women retired early as they were starting
  earlier the next day to finish the trek in three days.

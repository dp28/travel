  The plan today orignally had been to go for a longer hike to a mountain near
  where we'd been two days ago. We were both fairly tired when we woke and
  Rosie, somewhat out of character, said she wasn't really up for a hill today.
  Instead, we had an easy day catching up on stuff and resting and I'm glad we
  did. <R> This is going to sounds rediculous but sometimes you just need a day
  where you chill out. </R>

  We'd done quite a lot in the past few weeks and with a bit of a break we were
  able to deal with a few things that had fallen by the wayside. I was further
  behind with the diary than I'd ever been and, while I had added stuff to the
  site yesterday, I'd left a bit of a mess in the Git history, so adding in the
  next set of diary entries was going to be a pain.

  We whiled away the day, writing and reading our books. We'd bought lunch
  yesterday, so had that. I tried again to improve the bar Dairy Milk I had by
  melting it and dipping a banana into it (good, but still not great). We also
  booked the flights for the end of our trip - from Quito to San Diego on the
  7th of June (with a nice 11 hour layover in Fort Lauderdale, can't wait), and
  just for me, from San Diego to Belfast just over a week later. We must have
  hit the sweet spot for booking flights - a Wednesday a couple of months
  beforehand - because my flight at least was quite a bit less than the last
  time I'd looked (just under Â£300). Admittedly, it's got two longish
  connections and probably not the best transatlantic flight, but it is cheap.

  For dinner, we decided to return to the place we went a couple of days ago
  with the 40% discount. We were hungry, it was just before 7pm, we knew it would
  be open, good value, and have delicious burrata. It wasn't as good as the
  first time, but it was good. Through some slight miscommunication with the
  waiter we ended up with the same wine as last time, but we did both like it
  (Las Perdices Malbec).

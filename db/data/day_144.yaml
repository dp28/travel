  We'd booked a trek starting tomorrow, so what better way to prepare than
  another hike? We decided on one of the most popular day trips from Huaraz -
  the imaginatively-named laguna 69 (the 69th lake in Huascaran National Park,
  apparently).

  This did mean that we needed to get up at 4.40am - not really a problem given
  how difficult it was to sleep there. The bus was supposed to arrive between 5
  and 5.20, but was late enough that we were on the point of going back to bed.

  We caught a bit of rubbish bus sleep for the next two hours, then ate our
  packed breakfast at a restaurant in a small village. We saw a couple of
  different lakes (numbers 67 and 68, I think) which were both a bright
  turquoise.

  Our bus stopped at the corner of a switchback in the road and we all piled out
  to start walking. After far too long couped up in buses during the last few
  days we were ready for some exercise and quickly made it to almost the front
  of the group. The altitude probably helped as we were at around 4,000m and are
  definitely acclimatised by now, while lots of other people there probably
  haven't been at altitude for long.

  The path went from flat to steep to flat to steep. We made it up to the laguna
  with plenty of time to spare, so there were less than ten other people when we
  arrived. The lake is spectacularly blue, set just under a glacier that covers
  multiple peaks. We could hear the sound of a waterfall on the other side of
  the lake, coming down from the glacier.

  We had some of our snacks (sweet and salty almond granola bars are
  surprisingly good) while more and more people arrived. We slowly got colder,
  so after about an hour and a half (and loads of photos) we headed down. We had
  a little bit of a wait at the botom for the rest of our bus to arrive, but not
  for too long.

  Back in Huaraz, we changed hotel so that we could actually get some sleep. The
  decent warm shower was a great bonus. We tried to return to the same
  restaurant as the night before as it was close, quick and tasty, but it closes
  on Sundays. We decided on another pizza place, but regretted it when we
  realised just how slow and inefficient their system was. <R> It took them 50
  minutes to make like 8 pizzas. </R>

  Back in the hotel (later than we would like), we packed for our four-day trek
  and finally got some sleep.

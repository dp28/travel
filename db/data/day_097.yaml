  We visited another couple of wineries today, this time in an area called
  Luyan de Cuyo. We'd both separately found recommendations to hire bikes from
  the well named Baccus Bikes who gave us a map, recommendations for where to go
  and even booked lunch for us.

  Luyan de Cuyo is a little bit south of central Mendoza, so we needed to get a
  bus. We walked to one bus stop and immediately gave up as the road was blocked
  off for work. We walked to another stop and waited for 45 minutes before
  giving up. The bus system here is a bit odd - all buses have a big number for
  the rough area they're going to and a small number for the exact route. This
  means that from a distance many buses look like your bus, but end up not being
  so. After two or three buses hadn't shown up that were supposed to, we walked
  to the next bus stop and finally caught one.

  After picking up our somewhat expensive bikes, we headed to the first
  recommendation - Carmelo Patti's winery. Apparently, Carmelo Patti is a
  stalwart of the wine scene here and he had the newspaper cutouts to display
  reviews of him and his wine from across the world. His place was quite
  different to all the others we'd been to. It wasn't at a vineyard (although I
  think he has at least one), but at a warehouse where he stores the bottles. He
  also buys other people's grapes and creates blends there, too. In addition, at
  most of the places we've been so far the wine has at most a year in the bottle
  before it is sold. Carmelo stores his for four to eight years so that people
  who buy it don't have to do so in their own wine cellars (according to him).

  We had a quick tour with three others who had also rented bikes from Baccus.
  Carmelo only speaks Spanish, so it was a bit of a test, but we got most of it.
  He showed us that he stores the bottles in cardboard boxes and keeps the
  bottles upside down so that the cork doesn't dry out and the wine doesn't
  oxidise. He told us that if we buy wine and plan on keeping it for more than a
  few months, we should take off the wrapper around the neck to inspect the
  cork. If there is obvious discolouration in a line down the height of the
  cork, the wine will oxidise and should be drunk soon. Otherwise, the wine can
  be stored for twenty years on its side (out of light).

  We tasted three of his wines, giving him a chance to give us another tip.
  Apparently it can be hard to open older bottles of wine, but if you warn the
  neck of the bottle with a lighter, the cork should become easier to remove.
  The wines we tasted were a Malbec which had been bottled four years ago, a
  Cabernet Sauvignon bottled eight years ago and a blend of Malbec, Cabernet
  Sav, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. They were all quite nice, but the wines I've
  liked most so far were all younger.

  His place was really busy, with people there before and after us. He seemed to
  really enjoy teaching people about wine and in having so many guests from all
  over the world - he was particularly proud of his eleven large guest books
  where everyone wrote something after their visit. There was no charge for our
  visit, either, and not even a sign outside his property saying where it was.

  We didn't have far to the next winery and went with the three women we'd had
  the tour with. I could very slightly feel the wine, but we cycled on the hard
  shoulder most of the way.

  This winery, Lagarde, came highly recommended by Bridget who had been here a
  few months ago. It's one of the older vineyards at around 110 year old. We had
  missed the scheduled our but it was also the place we had booked lunch. Like a
  few days ago, lunch was a six course menu with paired wines (a Viogner,
  Chardonnay, Merlot, Malbec, and a sparkling blend). The food was delicious and
  inventive, but would be difficult to replicate. Two of the starters contained
  ice cream - one basil, the other red pepper. The steak portion in the main
  course was absolutely massive, I couldn't quite finish it. Luckily, there was
  space in the pudding stomach for the peach tart and almond praline that
  followed.

  Throughout our meal, there was a group of people at a nearby table who had
  appeared with their own photographer and videographer. It was a bit weird
  seeing how much of their meal was split up with posing for one or the other,
  but we never really worked out who they were or what was going on.

  After our meal, despite not finishing most of my (generous) tasting glasses, I
  could feel the wine. We spent quite a long time wandering through the
  vineyards and gardens where some of the veg we'd eaten had been grown. We saw
  plenty of olive trees dotted among the vines and flocks of birds flew between
  them. We saw some of the irrigation channels being filled to water lines of
  vines.

  After a good while, we cycled to our last stop, a little shop called A La
  Antigua selling homemade preserves, savoury spreads and liqueurs. They also
  let us taste many of these - including a few olive spreads, a raspberry
  vinegar and some flavoured dulce de leches. We wanted to buy something, but
  apparently the border crossing to Chile is very strict. Instead, we gave them
  a little bit of money.

  We left back the bikes and caught a bus back to Mendoza. Completely stuffed,
  we did not need dinner. We spent the evening searching for a pinguino in a
  few tourist shops. Literally meaning "penguin", pinguinos are ceramic penguins
  used to hold and pour wine which we'd seen in Buenos Aires and Rosie was
  endeared with. We found what we were looking for and went back to the hostel.
  I finally added the diary entries from Australia to the site and ended up
  going to sleep pretty late (around 1am).

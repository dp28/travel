  We got an early breakfast (like the previous two days, banana pancakes that
  almost definitely contain coconut milk - poor Rosie), then a five minute lift
  to the airport. To our surprise, the guy from our hotel had insisted on being
  there around an hour and a half before the flight. It's a tiny airport, but we
  trusted his judgement. That meant we wound up outside the airport at 6am (for
  our 7.20am flight) with a small group of other passengers waiting for the
  airport to open...

  Maybe twenty minutes later, we got in, quickly checked in and got through
  security along with the seven or eight other people there. We read until being
  allowed on the plane, where we both fell asleep pretty quickly. At some point
  I woke up with some plane food in fornt of me, so had a little and read for
  the rest of the flight.

  From the airport we managed to get a Grab, despite internet reports that this
  wasn't possible from Denpasar airport. I don't think the driver was thrilled
  to take us as far as we wanted to go, but we did need to get there.

  We ended up in Padang Bai, a port that seems to mainly exist to transport
  people to the Gili islands (our next stop). We arrived at about 11am, before
  our hotel was ready for us. It turned out we could probably have gotten to the
  Gilis directly today, but couldn't be sure beforehand.

  We had an ok lunch and spent the afternoon on the beach, reading on some
  sunloungers. The warung (small restaurant / foodstand) owning the sunloungers
  seemed to suffer from a problem common to most of the places similar to it
  across all the countries we've been - it had an extensive menu, but a large
  proportion wasn't actually available. In this case it was most of the drinks,
  so no banana shake here. Ah well, dinner was a lot better, with really good
  toasted cheese sandwiches and a creamy purple rice pudding. <R> The beach was 
  down a small path from the main road which was well signposted from the road 
  as being 300m away. After following the path for about 200m we came upon another 
  sign, this one upside down also stating that the beach was 300m away, and then 
  another 200m along was a third sign saying it was 300m to the beach. Not one of
  those signs was correct. </R>

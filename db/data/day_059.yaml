  The main activity for today was to go to the Batu caves just north of KL. We
  made our way to the nearest station we could get a train from only to find
  that there is maintenance being done on the line. We walked to another station
  and got a (packed) free shuttle bus to yet another station, then eventually
  got a train. The first carriage was full and the next two were "ladies only",
  but we did find some seats.

  The caves themselves were impressively large, but we were somewhat put off by
  the number of other tourists and the gift shops within the caves themselves.
  That, and the large number of opportunistic monkeys. They were long-tailed
  macaques, the same species that had tried to rush us on Penang Hill. Despite
  the signs, quite a few people here were feeding them (one woman was selling
  bananas to specifically to feed to the monkeys), which is a quick way to
  encourage them to be aggressive towards people.

  We didn't stay that long at the caves. We got the train back into the city
  centre, stopping at a mall to get lunch at the food court. It was lucky that
  we did - it started to pour a few minutes after we went inside.

  After eating, we walked over to a money museum in the national bank. It was
  pretty fun, with quite a few decent interactive exhibits. The best was
  probably a brief overview of the history of finance where you had to pedal a
  bike to continue the film. There were examples of money from most countries of
  the world and 1 million ringgit displayed as the walls of the tunnel. We
  learnt more about the history of Malaysia and its economic development. There
  was also a section on Islamic banking, but we both left more confused than
  when we entered, unsure how banking and insurance can work without interest,
  uncertainty, uneven risk, late payments or value that isn't directly derived
  from physical goods.

  Afterwards, to get a good view of the city, we went to the Heli Lounge. It's a
  bar on an old heli pad at the top of a 34 storey building. It was packed, so
  we didn't manage to find a seat. The views were decent, though, and the
  cocktails were prety good and not **too** expensive.

  We'd heard that there was really good street food at another mall, but were
  disappointed when we got there. Instead we went to a Chinese fusion restaurant
  which had some great food, especially the breaded lamb & camambert balls.

  Back at the hostel, we found the wifi in the common area and had a booking
  bonanza, booking the rest of our time in Malaysia, Singapore and deciding on
  where we are going to go for most of Indonesia (assuming we're actually able
  to book the flights we want - 12 hours later and it's still not worked...).

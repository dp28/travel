:entry: "The main activity for today was to go to the Batu caves just north of KL.
  We\nmade our way to the nearest station we could get a train from only to find\nthat
  there is maintenance being done on the line. We walked to another station\nand got
  a (packed) free shuttle bus to yet another station, then eventually\ngot a train.
  The first carriage was full and the next two were \"ladies only\",\nbut we did find
  some seats.\n\nThe caves themselves were impressively large, but we were somewhat
  put off by\nthe number of other tourists and the gift shops within the caves themselves.\nThat,
  and the large number of opportunistic monkeys. They were long-tailed\nmacaques,
  the same species that had tried to rush us on Penang Hill. Despite\nthe signs, quite
  a few people here were feeding them (one woman was selling\nbananas to specifically
  to feed to the monkeys), which is a quick way to\nencourage them to be aggressive
  towards people. <R> Evil little monkeys. </R>\n\nWe didn't stay that long at the
  caves. We got the train back into the city\ncentre, stopping at a mall to get lunch
  at the food court. It was lucky that\nwe did - it started to pour a few minutes
  after we went inside.\n\nAfter eating, we walked over to a money museum in the national
  bank. It was\npretty fun, with quite a few decent interactive exhibits. The best
  was\nprobably a brief overview of the history of finance where you had to pedal
  a\nbike to continue the film. There were examples of money from most countries of\nthe
  world and 1 million ringgit displayed as the walls of the tunnel. We\nlearnt more
  about the history of Malaysia and its economic development. There\nwas also a section
  on Islamic banking, but we both left more confused than\nwhen we entered, unsure
  how banking and insurance can work without interest,\nuncertainty, uneven risk,
  late payments or value that isn't directly derived\nfrom physical goods. <R> One
  google session later and I am still super \nconfused. </R>\n\nAfterwards, to get
  a good view of the city, we went to the Heli Lounge. It's a\nbar on an old heli
  pad at the top of a 34 storey building. It was packed, so\nwe didn't manage to find
  a seat. The views were decent, though, and the\ncocktails were prety good and not
  **too** expensive. <R> I mean compared to \nthe rest of KL, expensive, compared
  with London, really cheap. </R>\n\nWe'd heard that there was really good street
  food at another mall, but were\ndisappointed when we got there. Instead we went
  to a Chinese fusion restaurant\nwhich had some great food, especially the breaded
  lamb & camambert balls.\n\nBack at the hostel, we found the wifi in the common area
  and had a booking\nbonanza, booking the rest of our time in Malaysia, Singapore
  and deciding on\nwhere we are going to go for most of Indonesia (assuming we're
  actually able\nto book the flights we want - 12 hours later and it's still not worked...).\n"

  I've let these get out of hand again - I'm writing six days later ...

  We left Gili Meno, Indonesia and South East Asia today. We didn't have to be
  at the harbour until 11am, so we had a leisurely breakfast and packed
  afterwards. We waited at the harbour for about 45 minutes while talking to a
  Californian couple who were traveling after finishing teaching English in
  (South) Korea for a year.

  The ferry was loud, bumpy and not direct - we stopped at Gili Air & Lombok
  before turning around to head to Bali. It was ok, but not quite as nice as the
  way to Gili Meno (and neither of us saw any dolphins this time). When we
  arrived at Padang Bai port we were ushered onto a minibus (while, as usual,
  many people tried to sell us taxi rides). Before getting on we used probably
  one of the dirtiest toilets we've seen so far and paid for the privelege.

  The minivan to the airport was pretty uncomfortable and only had four
  passengers including us. We spent most of the hour and a half journey coming
  up with possible three course meals we could make (both somewhat missing
  cooking). Near the airport the driver told us we had to pay the airport
  entrance fee, which we had also been asked for when leaving the airport in a
  Grab. In both cases it probably should have been included in the fare, but it
  was a small amount of money ...

  We were very early for our flight - it left at 10pm and we arrived at about
  4pm. Pretty hungry by this point, we went on a hunt for food with a
  fully-laden airport trolley. Of course, wandering outside an airport with
  luggage meant that we were constantly bombarded with calls of "Taxi?" and
  "Where are you going? I give you good price". When we replied "Sydney,
  Australia", some stopped, but many just replied without listening, just saying
  "Yes, cheap price". Like other places, saying no to a taxi driver meant that
  the one behind him would ask us the same question, despite clearly seeing us
  say no to the first ...

  Anyway, I managed to get a warm rotiboy coffee bun, but there wasn't a great
  selection of food. We ended up at a cafe outside the check in & departures
  area and stayed there for quite a while. When check in opened, we made our
  way through (with the somewhat standard visa faff along the way). Our gate was
  6A, so we sat down at gate 6 and waited, listening to the many gate changes
  ("due to an aircraft parking change, flight X has been moved to gate Y") which
  seemed to occur for most flights. We didn't realise that gate 6A was located
  **underneath** gate 6, not beside it like all the other gates ... It's been a
  probably at least 10 years since my name was called over an airport tannoy
  system (the last time was in Bristol, I think, where missing the flight would
  have been less problematic).

  We made it onto the flight to Sydney. Rosie immediately tried to get to sleep
  (probably sensible - it was a six-hour overnight flight), but I watched the
  second Kingsman movie on my phone (free Wifi so that Virgin Australia didn't
  have to install screens in their seats).

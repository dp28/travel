  After another night of not great sleep (thank you, jet lag), we woke up still
  pretty tired. Our plan had been to take the train north to the river delta at
  Tigre, which is supposed to be picturesque. However, while it was cheap to get
  there, it didn't look like it would be as cheap to do some kayaking as we had
  hoped. We'd probably just end up sitting on a boat and going to ok museums, so
  we decided to just stay in BA centre.

  We took the opportunity to go on the walking tour we'd missed yesterday, and
  I'm glad we managed to go on it. We had a different guide, but the three other
  tourists who'd been on our other tour happened to be there too, along with a
  Danish couple and an English/French guy.

  The tour focused more on the politics and history of Buenos Aires, starting at
  the congress building, which is very similar to the US Capitol Building. Our
  guide told us a bit more about the structure of Buenos Aires and how it is
  based around the avenue Rivadavia beside congress. This avenue runs east to
  west through the entire city. Many north to south roads cross it and change
  names as they do so. On these north to south streets, addresses are given by
  the number of metres to Rivadavia and each block is 100 metres, making it
  pretty easy to work out how far you are from other places. In addition, the
  square outside congress contains a large white stone with "0km" on it which is
  the exact location used throughout Argentina to calculate distances to Buenos
  Aires. <R> The whole city feels like it was drawn on graph paper by someone
  with a very long ruler. </R>

  As we walked on, our guide pointed out some of the older buildings, built
  during the golden era of Buenos Aires when it saw itself as "the Paris of
  South America". One of the most interesting was heavily influenced by Dante's
  divine comedy and had been the largest building in South America at 100m when
  it was built, one metre for each canto of the Divine Comedy. Apparently it had
  been built by two Italian immigrants who, during WWI, were afraid that Europe
  would no longer be a safe resting place for Dante's ashes and wanted to build
   a sanctuary for them. The ashes was never moved, but the building has many
   designs inspired by the book, eg the basement and ground floor represent Hell
   with nine archways and monstrous statues. The middle floors represent
   Purgatory while the top few floors represent Heaven, with a lighthouse and
   balconies reminiscent of clouds.

  Towards the end of our tour we headed back to the Pink House and saw several
  protests for various things - according to our guide, they have an average of
  twenty a week. Later in the day we saw the most common demonstration - a march
  in rememberance of the 30,000 people who disappeared during the last military
  dictatorship in the 1970s and the women who stood up to it. As part of this,
  quite a few of the people who disappeared were pregnant women, so around 400
  children are believed to have been born to mothers held by the regime, then
  hidden with new names in other families. There has been a long running
  campaign to try and reunite the now-grown children with their biological
  families and our guide said that the 127th missing child had been reunited
  only two months ago.

  As we got closer to the Pink House, the English/French guy in our group kind
  of slumped and said he was fainting. We gave him some water (that vanilla coke
  bottle has served us well) and others gave him some coke and he perked up. He
  just hadn't had enough to drink, which is understandable as it wasn't hot
  enough that you'd immediately think to do so.

  Our tour ended by the obelisk erected in 1936 to commemorate 400 years since
  the founding of the city. Our guide showed us some of the hand gestures used
  by people here and told us what they mean (eg ways to order different
  coffees), many with similarities to Italian gestures, but slightly different
  meanings.

  We had some decent pizza at a place recommended by our guide and some ice
  cream near by (another food that's supposed to be good here, and it was). We
  had a look around the city cathedral, which used to be the cathedral of the
  current Pope. It's a bit smaller and more understated than many of the
  European cathedrals I've seen.

  We headed back to the hotel, mainly to try and find my hat. Rosie had had the
  great idea to WhatsApp the Uber driver that had brought us from the airport
  and sure enough, she had the hat. Rosie communicated with her throughout the
  day, wifi dependent and with good use of Google Translate. The hotel was the
  easiest place for us to meet, so we went back to wait and have a look at
  things to do in the coming few days.

  We went to a slightly fancier Italian restaurant for dinner and had some more
  good bread, pasta and wine. A little after we got back to the hotel, the Uber
  driver arrived with my hat in tow - Rosie saved the day. <R> Guys, words can't
  quite communicate how excited Daniel was to be reunited with his hat. </R>

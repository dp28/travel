  We left Cusco today, but didn't quite realise that our hotel's checkout time
  was 9am ... they seemed us ok with actually checking out at 10am, though.

  We had a small breakfast at a bakery we'd been before, then a quick tour of
  another Choco Museo (I couldn't resist). The shot of hot chocolate was worth
  it.

  We'd booked another cooking class for today, which turned out to be by a chef
  who used to work at the previous class we'd gone to. We'd specifically asked
  for a different menu so we didn't just make the same thing, so had a private
  class. That was great - we skipped the normally standard market visit and had
  plenty of space in the kitchen (it would have been cramped with a group of
  more than four).

  We made another passionfruit pisco sours (that's ok, they're prety tasty) and
  learnt that not only is Pisco named after a own in Peru, it's named after the
  ceramic jars from Pisco that it is aged in, also called piscos.

  Our starter was another Japanese/Peruvian fusion called tiraditos. It's
  similar to ceviche in that it's white fish cooked in acid, but everything
  isn't mixed together. Instead, we laid thin slices of fish on a plate, then
  covered it with a lime and coriander sauce, then added chunks of avocado,
  sweet potato puree and Andean algae. Rosie spent a long time ensuring all her
  avocado chunks stood up in the same way - I suppose the photos will show if it
  was worth the effort.

  Our main course was quinoa-crusted alpaca steaks on a bed of roasted potatoes
  covered in a chimmichurri sauce. Similar to British and Irish cooking, but
  hard to replicate as alpaca isn't the easiest to get hold of. The potatoes
  were also pretty different - one tasting similar to what I would call a
  potato, but with purple lines through it and another a vibrant yellow and much
  closer in taste and texture to beetroot than potatoes.

  Our dessert was a (massive) quinoa creme brulee. The quinoa was mixed in and
  sank to the bottom, giving a range of textures, but I'm not sure if it really
  improved the dish. We kind of cheated, too - the brulee wasn't blow-torched
  sugar, but instead a sheet of praline that had been crushed in a mortar and
  pestle then sprinkled on top. The best bit of the dish was the salt in the
  cream - our chef, Chris, put in a surprisingly large pinch, but it really
  added.

  The class finished just after 1pm, earlier than expected and giving us some
  free time that we didn't really know what to do with. Rosie got a cup of tea
  (it was still before 2pm, so it's ok apparently), then we sat in the main
  square for a while. From behind us we heard a real racket approaching until
  a parade of some sort spilled into the square. It wasn't that big, maybe one
  hundred people, but it was still mayhem, maybe with a hint of organisation.
  There were a couple of trumpeters playing some sort of tune, but way more
  people with assorted instruments just making a din (not least the children
  with airhorns). There were people dressed as circus performers doing some
  minor acrobatics and juggling and people in all sorts of costumes, including
  a guy with an oversized cardboard TV camera pretending to film them all. There
  wasn't an obvious reason for it all, so it was pretty bizarre.

  We watched the chaos for a while, then did a brief bit of souvenir shopping
  (you have to finish a trip like this with at least one ridiculous bit of at
  most semi-useful tourist tat). We returned to our hotel to pick up our stuff
  and got a taxi to the bus station, only to get caught behind the parade. Our
  driver said it was a protest about the price of living in Cusco, but if so,
  that is a strange way of protesting.

  We were very early for our bus, but at least there were places for us to
  charge our devices. The bus itself was pretty comfortable, but was still a
  fourteen hour journey. Just like a long-haul flight, the seats all had little
  screens in the back of them so we could watch Spanish-dubbed American films
  with English subtitles. Rosie's screen stopped working, so we shared (there
  were two headphone ports for each screen) and found the remake of Jumanji
  surprisingly ok.

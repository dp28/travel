  We had another lie in today and were better rested for it. We got the train to
  Circular Quay, stocked up on suncream, then got a packed ferry to Manly in the
  north.

  Once there, we stopped for a slightly dissapointing lunch - a Vietnamese pork
  roll (not as good as the banh mi we'd had in Vietnam) and a stodgy chicken and
  white sauce pie (not great despite the fact that Australia likes its pies). Ah
  well.

  We walked across from the harbour to the coast to see Manly beach - a
  significantly larger beach than all of the ones we'd walked past yesterday. We
  rented a foam-topped surfboard and changed into swimming gear, then headed to
  the beach. Rosie took our stuff and I swam out to the edge of crowds of
  surfers.

  The surfing was fun, if not quite as successful as our time in Lombok. My best
  wave was probably my first and I spent a lot of time duck diving under waves.
  I came in briefly for a rest, but Rosie wasn't that keen on having a go, so I
  went back out to make the most of the two hours with the board. The currents
  were strong and odd, with side currents from different directions and multiple
  dips in the sea floor level causing strange areas of weak waves but hard to
  judge current. I actually found it quite difficult to swim in the second time
  until I caught a wave (my second best) and got close to shore.

  After returning the board and leaving our valuables in a locker, we both went
  into the water in one of the few crowded swiming areas. Because of the
  currents the allowed swimming areas were tiny, with barely twenty metres
  between the flags. It was hard to do any sort of bodyboarding as the waves
  would just smash us into several other people packed into the water.

  We shoered and changed before catching the ferry back. We decided to just walk
  back to the Airbnb rather than get the train as it was only 4km. As it was
  Good Friday, many shops and restaurants were shut, but we found a decent place
  serving gyros (and also Chilean food today, getting us in the mood for South
  America).

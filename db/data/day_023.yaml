  We left Koh Mak at 9am from the pier just outside our resort. It was a loud, if uneventful journey.
  <R> With a distinct lack of chickens. </R> The speedboats they use have three pretty huge outboard
  motors, so it's not that easy to listen to anything else. I got a decent way through my book, though.

  Once we got back to the mainland we got a songthaew (with a very low roof - ouch) to the bus station
  and caught the 11am bus to Bangkok. Six hours of the Wheel of Time later, we arrived at a large bus
  station, refusing offers of tuk tuk rides because we knew that the trains in Bangkok were great.

  We were wrong. <R> So so wrong. </R> Traveling on Bangkok's public transport at rush hour is nothing
  like during the day.We needed travel two or three miles as the crow flies, which without rucksacks we would
  have walked.There wasn't a direct link, so we needed to go three sides of a square to get there - a skytrain,
  a subway and another skytrain, only a stop or two on each. Each train and station was increasingly
  packed full of people. In the second train, there was no room to move. We had to wait in line for
  about half an hour before enough people got off the skytrain for us to (just) fit on.

  After close to an hour and a half, we got to our hotel, which was surprisingly nice. Unlike our
  previous hotel in Bangkok, the windows actually opened to the _outside_, not just a fake hedge. We
  found an Islamic Thai restaurant & bakery and had some decent food, interesting (really sweet) Thai
  sweets and a fantastic strawberry shake - probably just ice blended with loads of fresh strawberries
  and a bit of sugar syrup. After the frustrating journey through Bangkok, the meal was just what we
  needed. <R> The strawberry milkshake in particular was on point! </R>

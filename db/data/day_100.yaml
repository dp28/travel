  We woke up on the hundredth day of our trip to find that our host had prepared
  a breakfast of yoghurt and granola. We left soon after to transfer our bags to
  a hotel nearby at which we were to meet Rosie's parents, who are going to join
  us for the next two weeks.

  As we were walking, Rosie's parents happened to spot us from their taxi, so we
  both scrambled into the taxi for the few blocks to the hotel. Once we arrived
  we were told that the rooms were already ready - ours had two floors with the
  bathroom and a second bed upstairs, separate from the main building. <R> Also
  the chalk board in the hotel had our names on it welcoming us to the hotel. It
  was all really very lovely. </R>

  We got the metro to a large park in the museum district, putting quite a bit
  of money on a single travel card as they can be shared here. We stopped for
  coffee and a muffin at the cafe of an art museum and Rosie and I did our
  penalty of 85 star jumps for snacking. A month or two ago we decided to force
  ourselves to do star jumps whenever we snack outside mealtimes to increase the
  amount of exercise we get. We started at 50 and add 5 for each additional
  snack. <R> The penalty has dramatically reduced the number of snacks we eat. </R>

  We spent the next hour at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, which focused
  on the atrocities committed during Pinochet's regime. The museum was focused
  primarily on the events themselves rather than the history behind it. We
  learnt that Pinochet was one of the generals that took power in 1973, bombing
  the President's palace where the President of the time, Allende, later
  committed suicide. The museum detailed the forms of torture used and where
  bodies were hidden and discovered, along with the reaction of the press, the
  people of Chile and other countries.

  After that sobering experience, we went to the old main square of Santiago and
  had a great Peruvian lunch (I had a chicken causa with fantasticly lemony
  potato). Apparently Peruvian food is more popular here than Chilean food.
  Afterwards, beside a large group of lined-up semiformal policemen, we joined
  a walking tour in English through the city.

  A lot of the tour focused on some of the more recent Chilean history,
  particularly the Pinochet dictatorship. We stopped outside the presedential
  palace - apparently the only place the Chilean Air Force has ever bombed (we
  saw the footage at the previous museum). Our guide was quite cautious because
  opinions are still divided in Chile. Some still see Pinochet as saving Chile
  from Allende's socialism and thank him for Chile's current relative wealth.
  According to our guide, when Pinochet eventually lost an election, he didn't
  fully leave power - he was still head of the military.

  Our tour guide was great and described quite a bit of the history, culture,
  food and drink, savoury or otherwise. I tried a traditional drink called Mote
  con Huesillo, a sweet drink with something like corn in it and several halves
  of dried peach. Tasty, but overly sweet. Another of the stops was at a street
  of "Coffee with legs" cafes - places which have female staff in short skirts
  and lots of mirrors so that male customers can appreciate their legs.
  Apparently, this started as a way of trying to market coffee to men. Now there
  are much seedier establishments nearby, just hidden from sight, but are
  occasionally raided by the police.

  I met an interesting guy called Eric on the tour with us. He was travelling
  alone through South America between finishing a Law degree and starting work,
  but also doing a distance Computer Science course on the side. He'd been to
  quite a few of the places we were going to, so it was good to hear his stories
  (and to briefly talk about programming).

  We ended the tour at one of Pablo Neruda's houses. He was a famous Chilean
  poet, Nobel laureate and politician. We then went to a beer bar nearby at the
  recommendation of our guide and tried a flight of beers (I mainly stuck to a
  pisco sour).

  Getting the metro back to the hotel ended up being a lot more complicated than
  the few stops we originally thought. After some misunderstanding, we worked
  out that during rush hour, certain trains on certain lines only stop at a
  subset of the stations. We ended up walking a bit further after getting a red
  train which bypassed our green-marked station (or vice versa, I can't
  remember).

  We had a great Italian meal for dinner along with several decent wines. I
  think (writing this weeks later) this was the first point we had the Matetic
  Sauvignon Blanc, which everyone liked and was probably the wine we had the
  most in Chile.

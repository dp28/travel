1	\N	\nSo, better write this down before I forget it all. I started in Edinburgh,\nfinishing moving out of my flat by shoving the last few things into my parents'\ncar (with their help). We managed to squeeze into the jam-packed car to go and\nsay goodbye to my granny before heading to the airport.\n\nWe arrived with over two hours to spare - plenty of time. I tried to check in my\nbag through the automated machines (human contact? Not for this software\ndeveloper), but it wasn't having any of it. I managed to check in at the manned\ndesk, but apparently could only get my boarding pass for my first of three\nflights (to Manchester). My bag, however, was given passage all the way to\nBangkok.\n\nThe flight to Manchester was fine and I was told that I'd be able to pick up my\nremaining boarding passes at the gate for my next flight. I passed a couple of\nhours programming in a restaurant (chosen because it had a few plug sockets) and\neating a surprisingly good lamb tagine.\n\nWhen my gate was announced, I packed up, found the gate, and asked the staff for\nmy boarding cards. They found them and were about to hand them over when one\nasked to see my ticket for my onwards journey from Thailand, apparently\nnecessary before being let into the country. Cue a look of _hopefully_ mild\nconfusion while my stomach lurches - Rosie and I were planning to leave Thailand\nby bus which can only be booked in person in Chiang Mai. Damn.\n\nOne of the members of staff recommended a website to book cheap bus tickets, but\nit only covered Cambodia. Improvising, I tried to look for flights from Chiang\nMai to Luang Prabang in Laos, near to the next stop on our itinerary. The\nairport wifi suddenly seemed so much slower as soon as I needed it to work.\nLuckily, Rosie phoned to check how the first leg of my journey was going and I\ntold her what had happened. Because both my internet connection and the queue to\nboard the plane was dwindling to nothing, Rosie found and booked both of us on a\nflight to Luang Prabang. Unfortunately, there weren't many left and we would\nhave to fly through Bangkok. Worse, the confirmation email was just a proof of\npurchase, not a booking. The booking email would be sent "within the next four\nhours". Great.\n\nThankfully, the airline officials accepted the proof of purchase email. I was\nthe last to get on the plane and my heart rate returned to normal. I sat back,\nrelaxed, watched some crappy superhero movie until the in-air entertainment\nsystem failed and I managed to get some sleep (thank you, travel pillow).\n\n<R> Meanwhile in California I received a rather panicked phone call from Daniel\ninforming me that he needed to prove onward travel from Thailand or they wouldn't\nlet him on the plane! I quickly tried to book the flight that Dan had told me to\nfirst trying the airline website only to be told that was only one seat, well that\nwas no good, we needed two... I tried a booking site for the same flight and it went\nthrough or at least they sent us a confirmation email, Dan made it on the plane.\n\nPanic over, crisis averted... not so fast. I logged into the booking site in the car\non the way to LA and found that the tickets hadn't been issued there was in fact only\none seat, I was unimpressed. This now left me stuck I didn't have any proof of onwards\ntravel and besides we were going to be flying back into Thailand from Laos, would we\nneed to prove onward travel then, would one ticket do both jobs. I hoped so and booked\na flight from Thailand to Cambodia from Bangkok air, or at least I thought I did, the\ncredit card didn't go through. So I called them, they don't accept card payments over\nthe phone, I would need to fax them my credit card (what?!) I tried another booking site,\nalthough I will admit I was skeptical of them at this point, and this one worked. Or at\nleast I was issued both a ticket and they charged my card. I then proceeded to have a\nlovely lunch in LA followed by a visit to the very cool Getty art gallery and then\nan equally lovely dinner before heading to LAX.\n\nAt LAX they didn't seem fussed about onward travel although they only issued my\nticket as far as China which I will admit concerned me. After standing in 4 very long queues\nI made it onto the plane, watched Goodbye Christopher Robin and fell asleep for\nmost of the remaining 10 hours. I was a little bit fed up with airline booking\nsites at this point. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:49.164099	2018-10-17 17:54:49.164099	2018-01-08 20:00:00	1
2	\N	\nI woke up feeling slightly worse than when I went to sleep, as expected from\nplane sleep. Once I'm off the plane I connected to the wifi to check that\nnothing else had gone wrong. Getting stuck in Manchester would have been\nfrustrating, but in Abu Dhabi it'd have been down right awkward. Once connected,\na stream of messages popped up. Uh oh. The last-minute flight was never booked,\nthere weren't enough places, so it was canceled. Didn't they know that\nwhen we booked? Terrible user experience. Bad software design was quite possibly\nthe cause. But most importantly, it once again left me without a ticket out of\nThailand.\n\nRosie to the rescue again! She booked a flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, a\nweek and a half later. That was a much better idea than my rushed earlier\nattempt. We were planning to return to Thailand later and would have to have\nanother proof of exit; that flight could be used as proof of exit both times.\n\nAfter another flight with a bad superhero movie and worse sleep, I made it to\nBangkok. I got my luggage, found the train into the city and got off near the\ncentre. After half an hour of wandering around I figured the connecting train\nshown on Google Maps at the airport may no longer exist. Admittedly, there had\nbeen a warning saying that the schedule may be out of date.\n\nI wasn't totally sure just how far it would be to walk to my hotel and may have\nbeen a _little_ intimidated by the idea of trying to cross the incredibly busy\nroads. When a taxi stopped, I told him where I was going and accepted the\nrip-off fare because I really just wanted to get some decent sleep. I got to the\nhotel, checked in, messaged home and Rosie to say I'd made it, then went to\nsleep.\n\n<R> Meanwhile in China, I landed, stood in a queue to be allowed into the terminal,\nand then stood in a immigration queue followed by a customs queue. I then tried to\nfigure out how to get from arrivals to departures (there is one lift that makes the\njourney), stood in a queue to get my ticket issued, proved onward travel and was\nhanded a ticket to Thailand (yes!). I then stood in a queue to leave through immigration\nand another to get through security and finally one to get on the plane. China seems\nto really like getting people to queue up. </R>\n\n	2018-10-17 17:54:49.425531	2018-10-17 17:54:49.425531	2018-01-08 20:00:00	2
3	\N	\nI woke up at 4am Bangkok time, 11am UK time. That was probably jet lag. I've yet\nto experience jet lag particularly badly - I just rolled over, went back to\nsleep and woke up again six hours later.\n\nOur booking included breakfast, so I helped myself to pastries, jam, orange\njuice and a bowl of cornflakes. The milk was definitely UHT but I happen to\nthink that one of the two ways UHT milk tastes good is on cornflakes (the other,\nobviously, being drunk straight from the 5ml plastic containers that are\n_possibly_ intended to be used for take away tea & coffee).\n\nI spent the next couple of hours reading the Bangkok section of our guidebook\nand a bit of the cookery-slanted South East Asia travel book I was reading.\nRosie arrived in the early afternoon, dumped her stuff, showered, and we headed\nout into Bangkok. <R> My stuff was delicately placed not dumped. </R>\n\nTo get a bit of background on Thailand, we went to the guidebook-recommended\nMuseum of Siam. The museum was primarily focused on trying to determine "What\nis Thainess", highlighting the importance of the nation, religion and monarchy\nto its people. The exhibits in each of the 17 rooms were different in style,\nquite interactive and (mostly) in English. For me, the best and strangest room\nwas the one trying to determine how Thai certain outfits were by ranking them in\na pyramid formation. Some of these seemed clear after earlier parts of the\nmuseum, such as Rama being the most Thai and formal Thai costume being fairly\nhigh up. But what are "Bike for Mom" and "Bike for Dad" t-shirts and why are\nthey even higher? I'm pretty sure I'd never see a similar display in a British\nmuseum - I doubt there is a politically-correct way to determine how British\nsomething is, especially in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nAfterwards, we made our way back to our hotel, the Hotel Royal Bangkok. It was\non one of the main streets of Chinatown, blazing with the neon glow from the\nmultitude of signs. It turned out our hotel was bang in the centre of the street\nfood stalls in Chinatown, making it perfect for dinner. We wandered around to\nchoose a few, settling on shredded duck rolls, deep-fried vegetable spring\nrolls and surprisingly good deep-fried noodles & sweet chilli dip. We also got\ngot several things from a man frying small bundles of food wrapped in bacon and\nserved on cocktail sticks, mainly different types of mushrooms but also some\ntasty asparagus.\n\nWe finished the day with a cocktail each in the rooftop bar of our hotel.\nApparently it was a pool party but everyone seemed to be ignoring both the pool\nand the blaring music. The night skyline of Bangkok, however, was spectacular.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:49.557922	2018-10-17 17:54:49.557922	2018-01-08 20:00:00	3
4	\N	\nTo try and capitalise on our (Rosie's) jet lag, we got up at 6.45am to get out\nearly. Unfortunately, we lost a bit of time booking the train for Chiang Mai the\nnext day, but then went down to breakfast. I tried out some of the Thai food on\noffer - rice and several stews with some chilli sauce.\n\nToday was our day for seeing some of the main recommended sights of Bangkok -\nthe Grand Palace and Wat Pho. The Grand Palace is a former residence of the Thai\nmonarchy and also houses the Emerald Buddha (which isn't made from emerald). The\npalace complex is huge and the buildings are incredibly ornate and covered in\ngold. For me, the most interesting (and least crowded) parts were Chakri\nMahaprasat - a Western-style building with a Thai roof - and a smaller museum of\nitems donated to the Buddha, which includes models of what the complex looked\nlike when it was built in 1782 and what it is like now. <R> They seem to really\nreally like gold and they cover **everything** in it, you would need sunglasses\neven on a shady day, </R>\n\nWe then went to Wat Pho, a temple with a huge reclining Buddha, more intricate\ndecorations and a functioning primary school. It was recommended more than the\nGrand Palace primarily for its impressive Buddha and smaller crowds, but the\nsignificantly cheaper entry price and free water were greatly appreciated.\n\nWe haggled our way onto a tuk tuk to Siam Square and bought lunch at the food\ncourt in the huge MBK centre. From there, we caught the Skytrain (similar to\nthe subway, but built at a level **above** the cars) to Chatuchak weekend\nmarket. The market was _huge_, a maze of stalls selling anything and\neverything, from a plethora of tourist tat to pet cats.\n\nSomewhat overwhelmed and overheated, we settled down by a lake in an adjacent\npark to relax for a bit. We were fascinated and somewhat revolted by the size of\nthe catfish which fought over the food being thrown into the lake by people near\nby. <R> There was also a turtle! </R> After a while, we made our way back to the\nhotel on the subway. We finished off the night with street food and chilling in the rooftop bar.\n\n\n	2018-10-17 17:54:49.896324	2018-10-17 17:54:49.896324	2018-01-08 20:00:00	4
5	\N	\nTrying to keep the early mornings going, we woke up at 6.45am again. After\nbreakfast, we packed up & checked out of the hotel, leaving our bags there. We\nspent the morning pootering up and down the river on the public boats - a cheap\nand effective means of seeing the city from the water. The boats are long and\nthin - significantly longer than the boarding piers. The entry and exit of the\nboat is at the rear, so the driver cannot position it easily. To help, each of\nthe boats has a member of staff at the rear with a whistle to communicate with\nthe driver. They produced a whole raft of different noises for various different\nsituations, all of which easily cut through the low-pitched engine noises. (I'm\naware that "driver"and "rear" are unlikely to be the correct terms when on a\nboat, but I find them clearer because they're more general). <R> I found the whistles\nincredibly cool and not dissimilar to the way that a shepherd communicates with\na sheepdog... does that make us the sheep? </R>\n\n\nWe then briefly went to see a reasonably low-key Buddhist shrine, at least, in\ncomparison to the temples the day before. We had lunch in an enormous food court\nand tried to make our way to Jim Thompson's house. Jim Thompson was an American\narchitect turned soldier posted to Thailand at the end of WWII who became a silk\ntrader and possibly CIA agent. His house was an interesting mix of Thai and\nEuropean architecture and art.\n\nWe finished the day by picking up our bags and catching the sleeper train to\nChiang Mai. As I finish writing this, we've just had our curtained-off semi\ncompartment changed from two seats and a table into bunk beds and the air\nconditioning is so strong I'm cold for the first time since I arrived. <R>\nI did not expect to be this cold in Thailand, I almost didn't believe the\ntrain guy when he told me to wrap up warm. </R>\n\n	2018-10-17 17:54:50.233124	2018-10-17 17:54:50.233124	2018-01-08 20:00:00	5
6	\N	\nWe were woken up at about 6.30 am by the conductor announcing over the tannoy\nthat they needed to change our beds back into seats. We watched the sun rise as\nthe train pulled into Chiang Mai station, then packed up and left. <R> Guys they\nhad really English Breakfast tea, not just lipton!! </R>\n\nChiang Mai is significantly smaller and noticeably cooler (at least in the\nmorning) than Bangkok. It still has the moat and some of the walls of the\noriginal city, which we drove past to our hotel. We dropped off our bags, signed\nup for a trip the next day and headed out to see some temples.\n\nAfter Bangkok, we both knew we were pretty close to being templed out. However,\nChiang Mai has a lot of temples, they're mostly free and don't require booking.\nWe slowly wandered around as the day got hotter, admiring the architecture and\nseveral groups of topiary animals. <R> There was also some cool elephant statues\nat the oldest temple in the city. </R>\n\nEverything was cheaper in Chiang Mai, too - from the taxi to the food. The city\nclearly depends on tourism and the museum explaining the history of the area was\nvery well done. A lot of it focused on the founding of the city, whereas the\nannexation of the former kingdom of Lanna by Siam was stated briefly towards the\nend.\n\nWe rounded off the day by spending quite a bit of time booking our next few\nplaces to stay and transport between them - unfortunately necessary during a\nlong trip. We grabbed dinner at a near by night food market which had some\ngreat-tasting food. I love banana pancakes, so had to try the "banana roti with\nMilo" - an interpretation of the Indian flatbread roti filled with banana and\nfried, then layered with condensed milk and Milo (a malted chocolate drink\npowder). Definitely something I'll have a go at making!\n\n\n	2018-10-17 17:54:50.462068	2018-10-17 17:54:50.462068	2018-01-09 21:40:00	6
7	\N	\nToday we went on a tour organised through our hotel. It was an all-in-one kind\nof deal - see a couple of waterfalls, the highest point in Thailand, a couple of\nchedis, lunch, visit a couple of local tribes. Basically, we got on\na minibus, drove around quite a bit, got off for half an hour here and there to\ntake pictures, then back on the bus. Thrilling.\n\nWe both realised this sort of activity isn't really for us. We'd rather see only\nthe sites we find interesting (mainly the scenery) and be able to stop at things\nwe only glimpsed out the window, like the flower farms. <R> So apparently at the\nnational park that we went to there is an amazing walk that shows off the regions\nnative rhododendron flower and I really wanted to go to it but we weren't allowed\nto for some reason, which was really sad. </R> The obligatory market stops were no\nwhere near as informative a view on local life as the museum\nyesterday was. The repeated grumblings from the three people in the back seat\nwho'd been told incorrectly that they could go swimming didn't really brighten\nthe bus journey back. <R> However there were some very very cute puppies so that\nmade up for it. </R>\n\nSome of the sights were impressive, though, particularly the view from the\nchedis (or pagodas). It was interesting to learn that they had been constructed\nby the Thai Air Force, but we were unable to learn why particularly they built\nthem, other than in honour of the king and queen's birthdays.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:50.671047	2018-10-17 17:54:50.671047	2018-01-10 20:20:00	7
8	\N	\nThis was probably the best day so far. Straight after breakfast we were picked\nup and went to Asia Scenic cooking school. Maybe that breakfast was a bad idea.\n\nWe teamed up with a mixed group of ten other people and each chose seven\ndifferent recipes to make over the day. We donned strikingly pink aprons, toured\na local garden and market to learn more about specific Thai ingredients, then\nheaded back to the kitchen.\n\nIt was fun, informative and the food was informative. Rosie and I made\ncompletely different recipes, so we got the opportunity to taste plenty of new\nthings. Rosie learnt how to make a delicious northern Thai curry she'd had the\nday before, Khaw Soi, and I got quite a bit of two desserts, deep fried banana\nand blue sticky rice with mango. I really enjoy making curry, so it was great to\nget to make and try several curry pastes. Best of all, I'm pretty sure most of\nthe ingredients will be available in Edinburgh (somewhere) - I want to learn\nthings that I can make at home. <R> For some reason Daniel decided to make all of\nhis dishes super spicy which meant that he got a more lot of my food than I got\nof his... suspicious. </R>\n\nFunnily enough we didn't need dinner. We had a wander through the night market\nso Rosie could buy some Thai trousers (Thaits? <R> NOPE! </R>) and - shock horror\n- it actually rained! At least, enough water fell from the sky for two minutes\nto prompt the stall keepers to put out shelters, then the rain promptly stopped.\n\n	2018-10-17 17:54:50.998794	2018-10-17 17:54:50.998794	2018-01-12 17:50:00	8
9	\N	\nToday was a bit more chilled out it more ways than one. Primarily we didn't have\nanything booked, but in addition the temperature had dropped to about 18°C.\n\nWe spent the morning wandering through Chiang Mai with the aim of booking\ntomorrow's activities, our onwards transport, and most importantly, scoping out\nafternoon tea. Several of the more expensive hotels ($300 a night rather than\nour $20 a night place) offer afternoon tea, complete with an "artistic tower of\nsweet and savoury temptations". We ended up at 2pm on the riverside balcony of\nthe Anantara hotel with tea, scones, about fifteen different snacks and a\nmilkshake each. Admittedly, the milkshake probably works a lot better at the\nmore normal temperatures of 25-35 degrees. <R> Afternoon tea was amazing and\nis something I've always wanted to do! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:51.42528	2018-10-17 17:54:51.42528	2018-01-12 17:50:00	9
10	\N	\nThe main activity today was going to meet some elephants. It's a popular thing to do in Chiang Mai\nand was really interesting. There are loads of places that do it with very similar descriptions so\nwe'd spent some time having a look for one with good reviews that didn't include anything else\n(unlike our first tour).\n\nWe were picked up by a songthaew at 7am and driven, along with six other tourists, two hours out of\nthe city. A songthaew is one of the many adaptations of the Thai pickup truck - in this case, it's a\nstandard pickup with a roof over the back and a bench along each wall. I'm sure the breeze in the\nopen back is normally both refreshing and exhilarating, but unfortunately the weather wasn't any\nbetter than yesterday so we were all soon pretty cold.\n\nOnce we got to the elephants, the day got better. There were two of them, both very calm but also\nimpressive. We fed them sugar cane which allowed them to show their ingenuity - the male, Jimmy,\nstuffed a bit of sugar cane behind his tusk to maximise the amount he could get while storing some\nfor later. We then walked for about ten to twenty minutes to a river where we (mainly Rosie) gave\nthe elephants a mud bath, covering them in mud, then throwing water at them when they went into the\nriver. <R> They were just such massive animals that it was hilarious to see Jimmy wander into the river\nand roll around like a dog </R>\n\nWe were pretty tired once we got back to Chiang Mai. We had thought about going to a temple out of\ntown that supposedly was a great viewpoint, but it was still very cloudy so we opted for a walk\naround the city walls. We ended up chilling beside a pond in a park with a couple of ice creams,\nfollowed up an hour later by a surprisingly large banana milkshake (served in a jug, not a glass).\n\nBy chance, one of Rosie's friends from our halls in St Andrews, Tara, happened to have arrived in\nChiang Mai within the last day or two. We met up for dinner today with her and her boyfriend to\ncatch up. They'd been traveling for the past two or three months in many of the countries we are\nabout to go to, so gave us plenty of tips. We had a great meal swapping stories, then headed back to\npack up, ready for our bus in the morning.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:51.684025	2018-10-17 17:54:51.684025	2018-01-14 21:00:00	10
11	\N	\nI wasn't particularly looking forward to this morning. There's something about a six-hour bus\njourney in the immediate future that just hints that it's not going to be a great day. However, the\nbus was actually pretty decent - a reclining seat (including leg rest), free snack & water, and an\non-board toilet. We also spent the journey listening to a fairly intense part of the Wheel of Time\nseries, which made the time fly. <R> Note: You can convince Daniel to do just about anything if\nyou allow him to listen to the Wheel of Time at the same time. </R>\n\nUp next was the Laos border crossing, 4km from the bus stop. That required a tuk tuk ride, a $35\ndollar fee & passport photo for a visa, an extra $1 because it's the weekend and a songthaew 10km\nto the town we're staying in (Huay Xai).\n\nNegotiating the songthaew took quite a long time because we had to do it with the four other\ntourists who had just crossed the border. We all had different amounts of different currencies and\ndifferent ideas of what was a good deal. The driver spoke very little English and kept changing\nbetween giving prices in Thai baht and Lao kip. After everyone was somewhat happy, we were on our\nway - on the *right* side of the road. In Thailand, they drive on the left.\n\nWe found our hotel, dumped our stuff, got money, booked our bus away in three days and checked in\nwith our reason for being here - the Gibbon Experience, which we start tomorrow. Finished\norganising, we found a riverside restaurant to eat, read, and enjoy the sunset over the Mekong\nriver, <R> which was gorgeous </R>.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:52.04277	2018-10-17 17:54:52.04277	2018-01-14 21:00:00	11
12	\N	\nThis was the day I was looking forward to most, at least within the first few weeks of our trip. We\nhad booked the Gibbon Experience - three days spent in the jungle trying to spot wild gibbons,\nsleeping in treehouses and ziplining between them. For quite a long time I've had a semi-serious\nrunning joke that ziplines should be used in more places as a form of transport - I think they lend\nthemselves equally well to areas with tall buildings or large hills, plus they are far more\nenjoyable than other means of transport. <R> Just for anyone who doesn't know, when Daniel says\n"semi-serious running joke" he means that every time we are somewhere high he will mention that\nthis would be a great place for a zip-line. Every single time... </R>\n\nAnyway, I'm getting a bit distracted. We dropped off our stuff at the main office, had a rushed\nbreakfast, watched a safety video, then crammed into a tiny songthaew with four other people. It\nturned out being packed together so tight probably made it easier to stay in the back without\ngetting bounced out. After an hour and a half on tarmac, we stopped, picked up a few dozen eggs and\na can of beer for those that wanted it, then drove through a river onto an incredibly bumpy dirt\ntrack for 40 minutes. The beers were gone fast - every bump of the road caused them to froth more\nand more out of the can.\n\nAfter having lunch in the village we stopped at, we trekked up through the jungle to a couple of\nhuts and some locals playing a game somewhere between volleyball and football. We collected our\nharnesses and the group of 20 was divided into treehouse groups. Rosie and I ended up with four\nothers heading for treehouse seven.\n\nIn our smaller group, we made our way to our treehouse both by walking and by zipline. The wires\nwere rigged in such a way that they eliminated some parts of the path, with one zipline out and\nanother nearby for the journey back.\n\nThe flights themselves were fantastic. Spectacular views of the jungle both near and far, hundreds\nof metres long and many over a hundred metres high. Each was slightly different in terms of speed\ntowards the end, so we had to hold our feet up to try and go faster or squeeze a bit of old tire\naround the wire above us to act as a brake. Sometimes I wouldn't quite make it to the end, so would\nhave to grab the wire and haul myself hand-over-hand to the end. After getting off, we had to hit\nthe wire three times in a row to send a signal to the other side, letting them know it was safe to\ngo.\n\nThe final zipline was to our treehouse. It was 25 metres from the ground, or at least, to the bottom\nstorey (landing platform, toilet and shower). The middle storey was the largest, with space for four\ndouble mattresses & mosquito nets, a large, low table, ten stools and a sink with running drinking\nwater. The top storey was about five metres up, a little crow's nest with a single mattress to sit\non.\n\nWe revelled in the view. We had a spectacular view down the valley, surrounded completely by jungle.\nThe sun was setting just out of sight behind the trees as we took it in turns to have a shower -\nsurprisingly, the shower was the place with the best view in the treehouse. It was amazing, at least\nuntil plunging into the freezing shower water.\n\nOur dinner arrived by zipline - there was a small collection of huts nearby that served as our\nkitchen, with five or six people living there, including our two guides (at least for these two\nnights). It was delicious and plentiful, with four different dishes along with sticky rice and tiny\noranges to follow.\n\nWe ended the night swapping magic tricks and card games with our guides, primarily "magic" Mike (or\n"monkey" Mike as he also told us to call him). We played spoons, which was great fun, but probably\nscared away any interesting animals. I learnt a new game, called "game".\n\n## Rules to "Game"\n\n*Decks*: 1 or 2\n*Players*: 4+, in pairs\n\n* Each pair decides on a secret signal to give when one of them has 4 of a kind\n* Pairs sit opposite each other in the circle\n* Each player is dealt 4 cards by the dealer\n* One player in each pair looks at their hand, then gives it to their partner\n* The partner chooses any 4 out of the 8 cards they hold to keep, then returns the remaining 4\n* The dealer deals 4 cards face up in the centre of the table, then counts to three out loud\n* All players grab up to two cards that they need to form 4 of a kind, then discard into the middle\n* Once no one wants to swap cards with the middle, the dealer replaces the middle cards & counts\n* Once a player has 4 of a kind, they make the signal to their partner\n* The _partner_ then can say "game", ending the round, scoring 1 point for that pair\n* Alternatively, the partner can try and also get 4 of a kind, then say "double game", scoring 2\n* However, if another player sees the secret signal and says "stop the game", the pair scores -1\n* The first pair to 5 wins\n	2018-10-17 17:54:52.267454	2018-10-17 17:54:52.267454	2018-01-18 16:40:00	12
13	\N	\nSleeping in a treehouse has its ups and downs. Sunset - definite up. Rats and squirrels in the\nnight, however, don't improve my sleep. We'd stored all our food in a box, but the giant black\nsquirrels were happy enough to scurry over our treehouse, pick off bark from the tree, squeaking all\nthe while. Coupled with the snoring of one of our treehouse-mates, Rosie and I didn't sleep\nparticularly well either night in treehouse seven.\n\nAfter a delicious breakfast, we zipped and walked to treehouse one to try and spot gibbons. It was\nthe biggest treehouse, sprawling across two trees and at least four levels. Unfortunately we didn't\nsee any gibbons (apart from in a video on one of the guides' phones), so we zipped home for lunch.\n\nThe afternoon was more focused on ziplining than wildlife. We visited three other treehouses,\nincluding treehouse five, almost 50 metres from the ground (apparently the world's highest). At\nanother, we saw a bright green snake very slowly moving along a branch of an adjacent tree. We spent\nquite a bit of time at a tree which was the centre of a figure of 8 made up from four ziplines,\nflying from the tree to the ground, walking a bit up hill, then zipping back to the tree. The height\nthat we had to walk up to be able to zip hundreds of metres was surprisingly little. I definitely\nthink they should be used in more places ...\n	2018-10-17 17:54:52.475523	2018-10-17 17:54:52.475523	2018-01-19 21:20:00	13
14	\N	\nWe woke up to another cloudy morning, leaving an atmospheric (pardon the pun) fog in the valley\nbelow the treehouse as it burnt off. We packed up, had another great breakfast (bread and tamarind &\ncoconut jam), took a final photo of our treehouse, then headed back down to the village we had\nstarted at.\n\nIt was another bumpy drive back to the main road, where we stopped for lunch. We found out that a\ncouple of other people from our treehouse were also headed to Luang Prabang by overnight bus.\nThey'd already taken the bus once and were full of stories about how awful it was. Windy roads,\na cramped bed shared with another passenger, frequent stops, jammed full with people sleeping in the\naisle ... but if they were getting it again, it can't have been _that_ bad, can it?\n\nBack in Huay Xai at the main office, we killed a couple of hours showering, repacking and reading by\nthe side of the Mekong river. At 5pm, slightly apprehensive about the night ahead, we got in a\nsongthaew to the bus station. The bus was there and apparently different from the sleeping bus we'd\nbeen told about, possibly better.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't. We both had something between a seat and a bed with seatbelts that didn't\nwork and after a huge number of locals piled into the bus we had someone practically sleeping on our\nfeet. The driver took off, turning off the lights, but making liberal use of his horn. The road\nwasn't massively windy, but the stops did seem to be located about two minutes before I would\notherwise have been able to get to sleep. We did, however, manage to finish listening the the third\nlast Wheel of Time book. Only about 80 hours to go!\n	2018-10-17 17:54:52.713372	2018-10-17 17:54:52.713372	2018-01-19 21:40:00	14
15	\N	\nWe woke up (if you can call the brief spells of unconsciousness the night before "sleep") at 5.30am\nas the bus arrived. We shared a songthaew into town, dropped off our bags at our guest house, then\nwalked into the centre. <R> My bad night was made even worse by the fact that I had picked up a cold\nthe day before which had steadily developed over the course of the night to be a full blown case of\nthe sniffles. </R>\n\nOne of the main things to do in Luang Prabang, apparently, is to watch the alms giving at dawn. As I\nwas told by culturally insensitive American who wishes to remain nameless, alms giving is distinct\nfrom thanksgiving by the lack of turkey. It also involves considerably more Buddhist monks. It was\nas described - lines of monks walking the main street, being given food by others and photographed\nby tourists. <R> It was **very** early in the morning. </R>\n\nWe managed to find somewhere opening for breakfast, then went to the UXO information centre. "UXO"\nis short for UneXploded Ordinance - a problem that Laos, the most heavily bombed country per capita\nin the world, suffers from daily. It was a fascinating, if harrowing, exhibition.\n\nWe were then able to check in to our guest house and use the wifi to decide on what to do for the\nrest of the day. We found somewhere with a great sounding lunch that didn't disappoint, then caught\nanother songthaew, then boat, to a nearby waterfall. Because it's the dry season, the waterfall\nwasn't particularly impressive, but we were able to have a bit of a (chilly) swim.\n\nBack in Luang Prabang, we waited for the sunset beside the Mekong, then wandered through the night\nmarket. We weren't massively hungry, but couldn't say no to some street food. By far the best were\nsome small coconut pancakes / dumplings made in large dishes with ladle-sized indents, similar to\nDutch pancakes but far more moist.\n\nReturning early to our room, we caught up with home, work and sleep, despite thin walls and the\ndulcet tones of a guitar-playing fellow guest. <R> Literally every other note was wrong. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:52.96422	2018-10-17 17:54:52.96422	2018-01-19 22:00:00	15
16	\N	\nSleeping in a bit meant that we had a rushed morning to make our 9am cooking class on time.\nUnfortunately, this one didn't quite live up to our previous experience. The market visit was\ninteresting, both to see what's available and the condition it's sold in (plenty of flies around the\nmeat ...). At the restaurant, we had to decide, in our group of nine, which six dishes to make out\nof 27. We shared the prep of all the ingredients, then one person was assigned a recipe to a person\nto cook. We then ate all of the food together.\n\nTogether, this meant we made very little ourselves and weren't really able to experiment with\nflavours as we had been before. However, I did learn quite a bit more about how rice, particularly\nsticky rice, is used in Laos, and got to try, if not make, rice cakes and rice "whiskey".\n\nFairly full, we made our way back to the guest house and, because it had come up in conversation,\ntook some Myers-Briggs personality tests. These weren't very revealing - they all agreed I'm\nintroverted (shock!), but over three tests I was assigned different results for the other three\ncategories.\n\nAfter that short interval, we tried to catch the sunset from the stupa on the hill in the centre of\nLuang Prabang. The hill is about around 300 steps to the top and has various Buddhist temple\nbuildings on it. As we discovered, at sunset it also has  hundreds of people crammed onto the peak.\nWe decided to skip the crowds, so went lower and still got a decent view.\n\nWe returned to the night market and sat in a restaurant near the food part which had its own bakery\nstall outside. We tried black rice wine with and without lime juice - a surprisingly good addition.\nI also discovered their banana and avocado smoothie, almost chocolaty in its creaminess. I\ndefinitely need to replicate that if possible.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:53.219915	2018-10-17 17:54:53.219915	2018-01-19 22:20:00	16
17	\N	\nAfter a proper lie in (to 9.15), we got up in time to make proper use of the guesthouse breakfast,\nnot just rush through it. Our plan for the rest of the day was to visit Kuang Si waterfall, which\nseemed to be _the_ main attraction in Luang Prabang. At least, every time we walked past a tuk tuk\nor songthaew driver their standard question was simply "Waterfall?".\n\nWe wandered up to one of the main places to find tuk tuks, haggling with a few. We knew it was\ncheaper to share the 27km journey with others, so we wanted to find drivers with other people heading\nthat way. After a few minutes, one guy said that he could find us one to share and brought us to his\nfriend's almost full Toyota Commuter (not as common as in Thailand, but still _everywhere_). This\nseems to be a common way of doing things in Laos - lots of drivers and stall owners seem to work\ntogether, sharing business so that the person who can most easily provide the goods or service does\nand presumably the group benefits. <R> I will say that this is the only thing about Laos that I could\nreally think of as communist, despite technically being a communist county its really hard to\nwork out what means in real terms for the people living here. This was a running source of confusion\nfor me through out Laos and Vietnam. </R>\n\nThe waterfall was fun and quite impressive, particularly given that we've now seen quite a few in\nquick succession. We walked up to the top, had a go on a swing only just above a pool at the top\n(and ended up with wet feet). After an ice cream lunch we had a bit of a swim in one of the\n"refreshing" pools below the main falls.\n\nAlso contained within the waterfall park area was a "Free the Bears" moon bear rescue centre. Fairly\nlarge black bears, their bile is apparently highly prized for its restorative powers. There were\nabout a dozen bears and cubs in enclosures, rescued from bile farms or from being kept as pets. It\nwas hard to tell exactly what the intent of the sanctuary was - there didn't seem to be much said\nabout releasing the bears, but neither were they really being used as a tourist attraction, given\nthat entrance was free after paying to get in to the waterfall park.\n\nBack in Luang Prabang, we had the best meal of our trip so far. It was in a small restaurant on the\nmain street, specialising in a fusion of French and Lao cuisine. I had laap - a traditional local\nsalad made from minced chicken, plenty of herbs, spring onions and fried garlic - followed by slow\ncooked pork belly, rice, banana flower, carrots and lemongrass. Rosie had a trio of dips followed\nby a Thai shrimp bisque. I normally don't like bisque, but the creaminess combined with a lot of the\nflavours we've been having in local food and cooking with was amazing <R> seriously amazing! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:53.671171	2018-10-17 17:54:53.671171	2018-01-20 20:20:00	17
18	\N	\nToday was a traveling day, so not much to report. We were up early (5.30am) to get to the airport\nfor about 6.15 for our 7.40 flight. The airport was tiny - there were _maybe_ three other people\ngoing through security. The only (minor) excitement was that I found the key to our hotel room in my\npocket. Damn. <R> Sigh </R>\n\nWe flew back into Bangkok and caught a six hour bus to Trat. We're just spending a night in Trat on\nour way to Koh Mak, an island nearby. We managed to avoid a brief deluge, getting into our guest\nhouse minutes before it started. Afterwards we sampled many different small dishes at the local\nnight market, including (of course) another load of delicious deep fried foods - spring rolls, tofu,\nand noodles. In some ways it's not healthy, but food that we see being deep fried is probably less\nlikely to give us food poisoning. That, and it's incredibly good with the variety of sweet chilli\nsauces here.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:53.94908	2018-10-17 17:54:53.94908	2018-01-21 20:40:00	18
19	\N	(Today's post has a guest author: Rosie. Daniel cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of the information provided, and would actively question some of the opinions presented)\n\n<R>\nToday was to be an exciting day, we were heading off to the Thai island Koh Mak but first we needed to rectify a small issue of the day before, the fact that we still had the key to our hotel room in Luang Prabang, and for that we needed a post office. So we sent off into the town of Trat; before tea, before breakfast and accompanied by my ever present sniffles. I was what you might call grumpy, if you were brave enough. After finding the post office I left Daniel in search of the supermarket that maps.me (great app)  informed me was right around the corner in an attempt to buy some tissues that didn't feel like sand paper. After wandering aimlessly through aisle filled with 97 different brands and varieties of washing powder (who needs that much choice) I found the single package of tissues and had to rush to pay for them before I sneezed again. I found Daniel back at the post office and wandered back to the hotel where I had breakfast and a cup of tea and thus felt like a new woman.\n\nThe songathew picked us up at the hotel and took us to the port where we learned that among other fellow riders we would be sharing the boat with a live chicken. Which was fortunately confined to a box but occasionally left out a squawk of disapproval of such confinement. The first 50 minutes of the boat trip was relatively uneventful however the last 5 were wet, very wet. As we pulled into the harbour the heavens opened and as we got out, we and our stuff got very wet indeed. However by the time the songathew had dropped us off at our hotel it has stopped raining all together. I believe these downpours are reasonably common here but my goodness was it a lot of water!\n\nAfter a brief lunch where Dan ordered much better than me (annoying) we decided to go for a swim in the sea. We donned swim suits and Daniel then announced as much to his own surprise as mine that he didn't think he needed any sunscreen. This was in contrast to every day of the trip thus far where sunscreen has been liberally applied with a paint roller that he brought expressly for the purpose and which I am forbidden to touch (This is potentially a very slight exaggeration).\n\nThe sea was lovely and warm and surprisingly salty (I know, I know, but you forget these things) however the shower afterward was fresh and surprisingly cold so maybe things are different here. After showers we sat on the beach for an hour or two reading (and programming) and trying to convince the puppies that live at this hotel to play with me, there are four and they are adorable!! After a time it became happy hour however upon approaching the bar we were informed that the man who made the cocktails was out fishing so we would have to wait. He came in later with one very small fish but he looked very proud of himself and thus my mojito was not missed in vain.  By the time he got back however it was time to search for dinner and so we headed off towards the major town to a restaurant called Table Tales.\n\nThe food was great, and I got a mojito. We started with chicken satay and then I had scallops which were perfectly done and covered in garlic butter and Dan had a masaman curry which unfortunately was a little bit sweet, even for Dan (I know) but the roti that came with it was great. We headed back to the hotel, opting for roads this time rather than the jungle trails were had used to get to dinner. After admiring the moon over the water (and reading/programming) for an hour or so we headed to bed.\n</R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:54.250833	2018-10-17 17:54:54.250833	2018-01-24 16:00:00	19
20	\N	\nThis was a pretty chilled, lazy day for a number of reasons. Primarily, most weather forecasts said\nit was going to rain (it didn't). Secondly, we spent a bit of time working out how much we'd been\nspending, which has a tendency to make both of want to spend less. Thirdly, Rosie's cold isn't\ncompletely gone, so snorkeling isn't really that appealing. Finally, I wanted to get a bit of\nprogramming done - writing these posts is a bit more useful if I've got a site to put them on.\n\nWe spent the day by the beach, reading, programming, swimming and going for a bit of a walk to find\nlunch. There are quite a few swings hung from the palm trees, so we had a bit of a play on them,\ntoo. We spent quite a while looking for a good place for dinner, then headed back to our beach for\na game of cards (beanie) which Rosie won (in suspicious circumstances - she dealt half of the hands,\nafter all).\n\nPS. Shock of the day: Rosie got sunburnt and I didn't! <R> NOT true! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:54.433746	2018-10-17 17:54:54.433746	2018-01-24 16:10:00	20
21	\N	\nSomewhat like the day before, according to most weather forecasts it was supposed to rain quite a\nbit, but didn't. We took advantage of this in the morning by renting a stand up paddle board and\npaddling out to (& around) a small island nearby. It wasn't exactly an island - the water between\nthe shore and the island wasn't deep enough to paddle through, so we had to get off for a while. At\nlow tide it may be dry land, not that there's much tidal variation.\n\nOn the way back we were able to see plenty of lethal-looking, spiky sea urchins and fish, including\nlittle shoals that would repeatedly jump out of the water. We then went for a swim in the still,\nclear water. The threatened rain never materialised - much to Rosie's disappointment. She was\nlooking forward to being in the water while it poured down on us.\n\nWe spent the afternoon reading & programming again - I managed to get the site to the point that it\ncould display basic posts and load in all of the ones I had written so far. We then walked back to\nclose to where we'd been for dinner the previous day to a Swiss restaurant we'd booked for dinner.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:54.628299	2018-10-17 17:54:54.628299	2018-01-28 16:30:00	21
22	\N	\nThis was supposed to be the day with the best weather, but was much the same as the previous few\ndays - some cloud, some sun. We walked south to the beach we'd arrived at and rented a sit on top\nkayak and snorkel gear. There were a pair of small islands a couple of kilometres from the hotel we\nrented the kayak from which were supposed to be good for snorkeling.\n\nWe headed out towards the islands with small waves slightly against us and to the side - just enough\nto cause us to have to fight a bit to maintain our course, but not too strong. The water remained\npretty clear and shallow enough to see the bottom for quite a long way, but the waves meant the\nsurface wasn't still enough to see much.\n\nWe knew that one of the islands was privately owned and had a fee of 100 baht ($3/£2.50) for landing\non it, but we didn't know which one. We landed briefly on the first island, on a tiny beach with\nforest right up against it. The broken bits of coral there were incredibly intricate, but it didn't\nlook like the best place to snorkel. We kayaked out around the second island, avoiding a beach with\na crane and people building something, landing on a beach at the back. At no point on either island\ndid anyone appear to demand 100 baht - I'm not sure if there even were people on the first island.\n\nThe beach on the second island was stunning - a small band of white sand squeezed between the forest\nto one side and cliffs on the other, with forest covering the steep hill behind the beach. Not far\nfrom the beach was a tiny cove cut into the cliff with just enough of a sand bar for a single tree.\n\nWe went snorkeling between the beach and the cove and saw loads of life. In addition to the spiky\nblack sea urchins, there were plenty of small fish of a variety of colours and some larger, more\nimpressive ones - a delicate golden fish that we both initially mistook for a big leaf and a\nleopard-spotted fish (which I think was the same type as was caught by our host a few days before,\nrobbing Rosie of the chance for a mojito). The most impressive sights, though were the openings into\nthe giant clams. These were bright blues or deep reds, often sunken into the sand or something that\nlooked like a rock so that all I could see was a wavy coloured line, opening and closing.\n\nAfter snorkeling for a while, we got back on the kayak and headed back to shore.  <R> The wind had\nreally picked up by this time and we were kayaking at a funny angle to it so every other stroke we\nhad to try and correct our course, it was exhausting but good fun. </R> We were able to\nuse the hotel's outdoor shower and were sorely tempted by its pool, which we probably weren't\nallowed. We finished off the day at a bakery and art hut, which had some pretty decent food and\nseveral cats. After we ordered, someone was immediately dispatched to buy the ingredients (bananas)\nthat they'd run out of. I tried another avocado & banana shake, unfortunately not as smooth as in\nLuang Prabang.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:54.849193	2018-10-17 17:54:54.849193	2018-01-28 16:50:00	22
23	\N	\nWe left Koh Mak at 9am from the pier just outside our resort. It was a loud, if uneventful \njourney. <R> With a distinct lack of chickens. </R> The speedboats they use have three pretty huge outboard\nmotors, so it's not that easy to listen to anything else. I got a decent way through my book, though.\n\nOnce we got back to the mainland we got a songthaew (with a very low roof - ouch) to the bus station\nand caught the 11am bus to Bangkok. Six hours of the Wheel of Time later, we arrived at a large bus\nstation, refusing offers of tuk tuk rides because we knew that the trains in Bangkok were great.\n\nWe were wrong. <R> So so wrong. </R> Traveling on Bangkok's public transport at rush hour is nothing\nlike during the day.We needed travel two or three miles as the crow flies, which without rucksacks we would\nhave walked.There wasn't a direct link, so we needed to go three sides of a square to get there - a skytrain,\na subway and another skytrain, only a stop or two on each. Each train and station was increasingly\npacked full of people. In the second train, there was no room to move. We had to wait in line for\nabout half an hour before enough people got off the skytrain for us to (just) fit on.\n\nAfter close to an hour and a half, we got to our hotel, which was surprisingly nice. Unlike our\nprevious hotel in Bangkok, the windows actually opened to the _outside_, not just a fake hedge. We\nfound an Islamic Thai restaurant & bakery and had some decent food, interesting (really sweet) Thai\nsweets and a fantastic strawberry shake - probably just ice blended with loads of fresh strawberries\nand a bit of sugar syrup. After the frustrating journey through Bangkok, the meal was just what we\nneeded. <R> The strawberry milkshake in particular was on point! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:55.188136	2018-10-17 17:54:55.188136	2018-01-28 20:40:00	23
24	\N	\nAnother traveling day - up at 6am, at Bangkok airport for 7am, flight to Phnom Penh at 9am, arrive\nat 11.30am, bus to Kampot at 1.30pm for 3 hours. All in all, a good opportunity to make it\nsignificantly further through our books and audiobook.\n\nArriving a Bangkok airport two hours before was a good idea. The place is _huge_ and there were a\nlot of lines we needed to stand in. In addition, the airline we were flying with (Bangkok Airways,\n"Asia's Boutique Airline", apparently) has a private lounge for all its customers. Rosie got her free\ntea and we both got our fill of free popcorn, pastry, buns and (bizarrely good) curry ham\nsandwiches. They also included a free meal on our one hour flight. Not bad for $80.\n\nWe had to get visas on arrival in Phnom Penh, which was probably easier & cheaper than e-visas. We\ncaught the public bus from outside the airport for $1 (Cambodia uses its own currency, the riel,\ninterchangeably with dollars). Getting off relatively centrally, we made our way to one of the many\nsmall private bus stations to find a bus (in this case minibus) to Kampot.\n\nWhile waiting for the bus and on the bus itself we learnt that Cambodian roads are not like Thai\nroads and definitely not like British roads. In Thailand, there's a pavement and you can maybe walk\non it about half of it, the rest of it being covered with street food carts, someone's moped or a\nsleeping dog. If you want to cross a road, you walk slowly but deliberately across, maintaining a\nconstant speed, but still checking that cars or motorbikes will stop. In Cambodia, however, at least\nin the bit of Phnom Penh we were in, there _may_ be pavement, but it doesn't have space for you.\nNeither does the road beside the pavement - it's full of cars parked perpendicular to the pavement\neven though the painted lines are diagonal. You end up walking in the road, into the oncoming sea\nof motorbikes - many of the tuk-tuk-like vehicles here aren't actually a single piece, they're\njust a motorbikes with a detachable trailer. If you want to cross the road you follow the same\nprocedure as Thailand, although seemingly fewer people are likely to stop for you. <R> There are\nalso a surprising number of Lexuses </R> (Lexi?).\n\nDriving on larger roads seems to be different, too. Many of the larger roads in Thailand had\ncompletely separate roads going either direction. Not so in Cambodia. There, it's completely normal\nto overtake into oncoming traffic (as long as you sound your horn), meanwhile there's a good chance\nthat someone on a motorbike is undertaking the same vehicle you're overtaking.\n\nAfter that somewhat exciting bus journey, we were taken by an old, dying tuk tuk to our booked\naccommodation. It's a slightly bigger box than we've had so far, this time on stilts. The roof may\nor may not be waterproof and the walls do not meet the roof - making it somewhat less private than\nRosie would like while changing. It does have a decent sized mosquito net, however, but with a fair\nfew holes. It's even got its own large gecko, patrolling parts of the ceiling. <R> I named him\nBertram and he chirped happily through the night.</R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:55.43184	2018-10-17 17:54:55.43184	2018-01-28 21:30:00	24
25	\N	\nThe combination of only partial walls in our room, nearby people's fondness for techno music and\na persistent car alarm meant that we lay in until about 9am. I had a massive banana pancake with a\ngenerous helping of Nutella before heading off towards the main own of Kampot.\n\nWe're staying across the river from the centre, so crossed back across the railway bridge. The\nbridge itself does have a footpath across it as well as rails, but we needed to walk along a few\nhundred metres of train track before and after. There were plenty of people doing the same thing, we\neven saw a few motorbikes by the tracks the previous day. We learnt later in the day that there are\ntrains but rarely and fairly slow moving.\n\nWe wandered about Kampot, seeing the river and some of the odder Roundabout statues (eg, a giant\ndurian <R> bizarre </R>). We found a bookshop / cafe, which bought some of our finished books off of us.\nWe had pineapple pie and kiwi ice cream (the ice cream was better) at one of several "Kampot Pie & Ice\nCream Palaces" and listened to expats grumble. There seem to be a lot around. Most of the places\nwe've been so far have been filled with travelers around our own age, but Kampot (particularly our\naccommodation) seems to have a lot of older single men living here long term.\n\nWe rented a kayak from our guest house, paddling up the river a bit, looking at birds and trying\n(with little success) to pass an under-ripe mango between our paddles. After a cold shower, I tried\nto catch up with this diary, then had a delicious dinner at a Lebanese restaurant. I know we're in\nCambodia, but it was highly rated, it's still exploring different tastes, and they both have some\nFrench influence. Plus I got a banana & Nutella shake later (which definitely counts as Cambodian\nfusion cuisine).\n\nI finally caught up with the diary after dinner. It takes a surprisingly large amount of time and I\nwas 5 days behind ...\n	2018-10-17 17:54:55.730073	2018-10-17 17:54:55.730073	2018-01-28 21:50:00	25
26	\N	\nIt turns out our room did have a waterproof roof - at least, this morning's downpour didn't soak us.\nWe got up after it finished, paid and left, walking a mile or two into town with our rucksacks.\nRosie had found us an excellent breakfast restaurant and I had a fantastic meal of French toast and\nbananas covered in sugar cane caramel. The baguettes they do here have much softer crusts than a\nFrench baguette at home and lend themselves really well to French toast. The breakfast shake\n(banana, peanut butter, honey, cinnamon, oats) may have been a bit much, but was interesting.\n\nOur main activity for the day was getting to Kep, another coastal town 15 - 20 miles away. We hopped\ninto a (remarkably comfy) tuk tuk and asked to stop at La Plantation, a pepper farm on the way. At\nleast, it wasn't particularly near by either Kampot or Kep, but close enough. We turned off the\ntarmac road onto smaller, bumpier dirt tracks through currently empty rice paddies with the\noccasional cow, pig or chicken and chicks. <R> I am not sure that Daniel is accurately describing\nthe feeling of being bounced along in the back of trailer concerned that at any moment the whole thing\ncould just collapse around you... but hey there were puppies everywhere so I was happy. </R>\n\n\nOur driver stopped at a large building on the edge of a farm where we were able to get a (free!)\ntour. La Plantation is run by a French and Belgian couple, growing primarily Kampot pepper, which\nis one of the main products of the region. We saw plenty of it growing, along with specimens of\nbananas, pineapples, papayas, passion fruit, turmeric and bird chillis. We also learnt the\ndifferences between different pepper types and got to taste them all. We even tried Kamport pepper\nice cream, which, surprisingly, wasn't bad (at least in small amounts).\n\nAfterwards, we went the rest of the way to Kep in our tuk tuk and checked in at our (nicer) hotel.\nWe wandered into town and had a cocktail at the local sailing club while watching the sunset. We had\ndinner at a Spanish restaurant and probably witnessed a typical scene for a European expat living\nout their dream of opening a small restaurant in South East Asia - everything a little bit too\nhectic for him and the single other member of staff to handle, even with only three or four tables.\nThe water hadn't been working for the previous two days, but was now fixed, and half the food on the\nmenu wasn't actually available. The food itself was ok, not great, but it was fun to see and\nslightly reminiscent of Fawlty Towers. We also got chatting to an Austrian couple who'd been\ntraveling a lot.\n\n## Pepper types\n\n* *Red*: ripe pepper picked, boiled & sundried\n* *White*: peeled red pepper\n* *Black*: not as ripe pepper picked when green, boiled & sundried\n* *Long*: a different type of pepper, originally from Java rather than India. Shaped like a bumpy chilli (I prefer this one).\n* *Pearl*: the seeds within the long pepper\n	2018-10-17 17:54:56.012436	2018-10-17 17:54:56.012436	2018-01-29 21:50:00	26
27	\N	\nThis morning we got up late (9.30am) and walked a mile or two into Kep, <R> (it was definitely two) </R>\nwhich seems to have two centres. We had a breakfast of pastries at a French bakery and picked up food\nfor lunch. The main activity for the day was to be a walk, so we needed a bit of a picnic.\n\nThe walk was around Kep National Park - a small area of jungle-covered hillside just beside the sea.\nWe were given a map and quite a bit of useful advice at a cafe at the entrance to the park, then\nmade our way to a butterfly garden on the other side of the park.\n\nWe slowly walked up the wide path in the swelteringly hot and sticky mid day sun, enjoying the view\nand the sight of the occasional bird or squirrel. After about twenty minutes, I heard a movement on\nthe edge of the path and turned to see a metre-long hooded snake lying motionless, watching us. I\nquickly pointed it out to Rosie and we all paused for a second to work out how we can get away as\nquickly and safely as possible. A tiny part of me was also trying to work out whether or when to\nstop and take a photo. As I write this I've just looked up snakes in Cambodia and apparently a lot\nof the hooded ones here are cobras, all of which can kill with a bite and some of which can spit\nvenom. So I'm fairly glad that we didn't stop to take a photo. It would have made it easier to\nidentify, though.\n\nSeeing the snake did leave us a little on edge for the rest of the time in the national park, except\nfor in the butterfly garden. That was relaxing and tranquil (at least, once the loud group of\nschool boys left). There were loads of butterflies of plenty of different colours - bright blues and\noranges with speckles of red and brown. We spent a while taking photos, then left and had some cool\ndrinks in the shade. <R> it was just soooo hot </R>\n\nThe place where we had drinks had quite a few dogs, several of which followed / led us as we\ncontinued our walk around the park. <R> I named them Blackie and Blondie and they were great\nguides. </R> We turned off the main path onto a very steep and overgrown\ntrail through the jungle recommended by people from the cafe at the entrance. The dogs had far less\ntrouble than us and were somewhat reassuring company - they'd probably be much better at noticing\nany other snakes. We ended up at a spectacular view point looking onto the two sea front centres of\nKep, separated by another jungle-covered hill, contemplating how great a starting point it would\nmake for a zipline.\n\nLike yesterday, we finished with some cocktails watching the sunset, this time having tapas at the\nsame place (much better). The crab was particularly good and is what Kep is known for. I'm not\nnormally that into it, but here it was excellent. <R> Guys Daniel ate seafood three times in\none meal!!</R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:56.375162	2018-10-17 17:54:56.375162	2018-01-30 22:10:00	27
28	\N	\nThe day started with a four or five hour bus journey from the peaceful emptiness of Kep to the hive\nof activity that is Phnom Penh. It wasn't bad, pretty similar to our other daytime bus trips,\nunfortunately without free water or snacks.\n\nWe arrived around 2pm, hungry and quickly very hot. We found our hostel, climbed the steep steps to\nour top floor room to stow our bags, then headed out to find lunch. Afterwards, we focused on\nfinding a really nice restaurant for tomorrow's dinner - hopefully that will work out tomorrow.\nAlong the way, we saw the outside of the royal palace and monuments erected to the previous king and\nindependence from France. We also sat on the banks of the Mekong along with crowds of locals\n(it's currently a public holiday), hoping to see the full moon (apparently a supermoon) rise, but\nwere thwarted by clouds.\n\nWe ate dinner at a little street food place - fried rice and seafood. It was a bit disappointing,\nthough - the smells outside the little foodstalls and tables were much better than the food tasted\nand both dishes (surprisingly) contained baby octopus, which neither of us particularly like. We\nmade up for it with pudding and drinks down the road. The avocado milkshake was deliciously smooth,\nwith a subtle flavour, almost like drinking cream (not like I'd ever do _that_).\n	2018-10-17 17:54:56.824657	2018-10-17 17:54:56.824657	2018-01-31 20:55:00	28
29	\N	\nThe main event for today was to visit the harrowing Choeung Ek Genocidal Centre\n- one of the killing fields during Pol Pot's regime. I doubt I could describe\nhow awful and incomprehensible the history of the place is. Up to three million\npeople died during the regime, out of a total population of eight million.\nApparently, many of those who were executed were beaten to death because bullets\nwere expensive.\n\nWe didn't do too much in the afternoon, spending a bit of time during the\njourney back getting to grips with what we'd just seen and heard and how it had\naffected the country. We did small trip admin tasks - Rosie changed some of our\nleftover foreign currency, we booked tomorrow's bus and we wrote a mountain of\npostcards.\n\nDinner was at a French restaurant Rosie had found the day before. The plan was\nto try somewhere upmarket and highly rated and hopefully have a fantastic meal.\nThe food was good, but not as good as we were hoping. It was about as good as a\ndecent restaurant in Edinburgh at almost the same price.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:57.221427	2018-10-17 17:54:57.221427	2018-02-01 21:30:00	29
30	\N	\nAnother bus day. We were up early to get our 7.45am bus to Kratie.\nUnfortunately, Rosie wasn't feeling so well, something a bus journey was\nunlikely to help. Luckily, it didn't seem to make things much worse.\n\nWe arrived in Kratie six or seven hours later. It's a relatively small town, so\nwe were close to our guest house for the next two nights. We had a cheap lunch\nat the guest house, then booked tomorrow's activity and the bus for the next\nday. Then we planned a little bit of what we'll do in Chile and I caught up with\nwork emails again.\n\nRosie, despite not having much of an appetite, found an excellent place for\ndinner. I had a surprisingly good main - chicken bolognese crepe. I saw it on\nthe menus of at least a couple of the restaurants here and it was intriguing.\nCurrently, I'm trying to set things up so that Rosie can add photos to this\nsite, which, like most programming tasks, is taking a little longer than\nexpected. <R> I finished my book! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:57.486811	2018-10-17 17:54:57.486811	2018-02-02 20:20:00	30
31	\N	\nOur reason for coming to Kratie was to see the rare Irrawaddy dolphins. They're\nan endangered species of river dolphin found only in the Mekong, with only 80 to\n90 left. The largest group (about 20) are found near Kratie.\n\nDown here, the Mekong is pretty massive. It's about 2km wide and must be wider\nat times - apparently the water level rises by up to 15 metres during the rainy\nseason.\n\nWe started at a restaurant near our guest house at 7am with six other tourists\nand two guides, then were driven 20km up river and got into our kayaks. They\nweren't sit on tops this time, which was lucky because (a) it was hard work for\nparts, so having something to push my knees against was good, and (b) getting in\nthe river was pretty rushed, so I didn't have time to sun cream my legs (my\nlower inner thighs are burnt, however).\n\nWe paddled across the river, then down between lots of small sandy islands\ncovered in bushes, all of which must be submerged for months. We stopped on one\nof these to go for a swim (the current was good fun to play in) and have a\nsnack. The guides gave us bamboo sticky rice - sticky rice cooked with soya\nbeans, coconut milk and a little sugar inside young bamboo. You peel the bamboo\noff, leaving the rice covered in a bamboo paper that is edible.\n\nWhile on the island, one of our guides told us of many of the tensions\nsurrounding the dolphins and their history. He said that before Pol Pot there\nwere around 3,000 of them, but afterwards many people fished the river and had\nrelatively easy access to explosives and electrocution equipment. This made\nfishing easier, but killed dolphins, too. Now, there is foreign money invested\nto protect the dolphins, which works, but has its own set of problems. People\non the west of the river resent that the money is spent on the east, where the\ntourists go. People on the east are wary of corruption eats away some money\nthey would otherwise have access to.\n\nNext, we kayaked through a flooded forest. This was spectacular - large trees\ndotted sparsely through the river, sometimes close enough together to cause the\nwater around them to speed up. A large amount of their root systems were\nvisible, making the whole place seem overgrown.\n\nWe emerged into a flat expanse with the occasional sand bank and struggled our\nway back to the eastern side against the wind. We got a sense for just how\nstrong the wind and currents were. <R> ie. very strong! </R> We saw a few\nlocal boats with small groups of tourists on them, meaning we had arrived at the dolphin\npool. Apparently the dolphins prefer deep-water fish in that area of the Mekong, which\nis about 60m deep, rather than the rest, which is mainly 10-15m (at the moment).\n\nWe spent a while paddling up stream, then floating down stream looking out for\ndolphins. We saw quite a few, particularly towards the end. We saw the same pod\nof four or five surface quite a few times, sometimes as close as about ten\nmetres. <R> The dolphins were amazing, it's a real privilege to be able to get\nthat close to that many of such an endangered population. We probably saw about 20%\nof the total number of Irrawaddy dolphins left in the world. I really hope that\nall the conservation efforts amount to something because these really are beautiful\ncreatures. </R>\n\nWe kayaked a bit further down river, then hauled the kayaks up the bank and\ninto the truck. We drove back, had a lacklustre lunch, but a decent dinner.\nIn between, we updated the site (taking advantage of reliable internet) and\nwatched the sunset.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:57.714336	2018-10-17 17:54:57.714336	2018-02-03 20:50:00	31
32	\N	\nThis was probably our longest bus journey yet, starting just after 7.30am and\narriving just before 5pm with a half an hour stop for lunch. Not too much to\nreport, really - just a lot of road and a few slightly hairy moments as the bus\nhad to leave the tarmac every so often.\n\nWe arrived in Siem Reap and walked to our hotel, pleased to discover that our\nroom was bigger than our standard box and reasonably cool. We searched for\nsomewhere for dinner and headed to one that Rosie found serving twists on local\nfood. On the way, we saw the silhouettes of giant bats, flying foxes, in the air\nabove us. The food was pretty good, especially the prahok - a fermented fish\npaste in this case used in a thick sauce with shrimp and pork, served with rice\ncrackers.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:57.957374	2018-10-17 17:54:57.957374	2018-02-04 21:00:00	32
33	\N	\nDefinitely the weirdest moment of our trip so far - walking into a shop, asking\nto rent their bright pink tandem bicycle for 4.30am the next day and, oh, by the\nway, could they tumble-dry our puppet squirrel?\n\nExplaining the bike is easy enough: tomorrow we're going to cycle around Angkor,\na large national park full of partially ruined temples. The squirrel, however\nrequires a bit more explanation.\n\nAbout an hour after I wrote yesterday's entry, Rosie noticed a bed bug in our\nbed. We'd both heard horror stories from other travellers of incredibly itchy\nbed bug bites and how difficult they are to get rid of, so had looked them up to\nmake sure we could identify them. I squashed it and, sure enough, quite a bit of\nblood seeped out. Worse, we had a look and within a minute or two had found\nanother bug, which we caught as evidence. <R> Gross! </R>\n\nIt was after 10pm, we hadn't had the best sleep for the past few nights and\nreally wanted one good night's sleep before getting up early to see Angkor.\nNeedless to say, this really wasn't what we wanted to deal with. What could we\ndo? Try and change room? Change hotel at 10.30pm?\n\nThe hotel had one other room free, so we packed up our stuff and moved downstairs. We\npiled our stuff on the floor away from walls or furniture and searched the beds\nfor signs of bed bugs. There were some marks and black specks that could have\nbeen signs of them, but we weren't sure. We decided to just go to sleep and hope\nfor the best, not that we had much choice. We also weren't completely sure that\nthe bugs were from this hotel - we both had found small bites on ourselves at\nthe previous hotel, but dismissed them because they weren't itchy. Not everyone\nreacts to bed bugs, so maybe we were both lucky enough not to and accidentally\nbrought them from the old hotel.\n\nAfter a not-so-restful night's sleep, we woke up without being bitten. We took\nadvantage of having moved room to one with a warm shower (luxury!), then checked\nwith reception. The room we'd moved to was booked for the next few days, but\nthey gave us our money back for the other two nights we had planned to stay. We\nbooked ourselves into a new hotel across town, left our bags behind the hotel\ndesk and went out to explore Siem Reap.\n\nAfter breakfast and failing to find a bank, we spent part of the day in the\nnational museum learning more about the Khmer Empire, Hinduism and Buddhism. <R>\nI will readily admit that my knowledge of all three is lacking however the museum,\nwhile very informative only really added to my confusion. It doesn't help that there\nis a significant melding of Buddhism and Hinduism within the Khmer Empire but while\nI learned a lot from the museum I'm still just so confused about both religions. </R> We\nreturned to our first hotel, picked up our rucksacks and walked a mile or so to\nour new hotel. The guy there was very friendly, but said that unfortunately the\nfree bikes that came with the hotel couldn't be used at night, so if we wanted\nto get to Angkor Wat for sunrise we'd have to hire some elsewhere.\n\nWe had to head out anyway - we still had to get our laundry from our first\nhotel. It was pretty lucky we'd decided to do laundry as soon as we arrived the\nday before as bed bugs apparently often stow away in your clothing, so having\nmost of our clothes out of the afflicted room was great. However, a few of our\nthings did remain in the room until we left - most notably Rosie's\n[world-traveling squirrel puppet](https://www.instagram.com/travelingtufty/).\nWe couldn't really both wash him and take him to Angkor Wat, so needed to find\na tumble drier - one of the sure-fire ways of killing stowaway bed bugs. <R>\nUnfortunately most laundrettes in Siem Reap air dry the clothes they wash, which\nis good but didn't really help us in this (admittedly niche) situation. Fortunately\nas we were trying to hire our tandem for the next day I saw that the place we\nwere hiring it from also had a laundry service with a tumble drier. After some confusion\nthe squirrel was officially bed bug free and much much warmer. </R>\n\nWith our tandem hired and the squirrel cleansed, we set off on the bike to pick up\nthe laundry. Until now, I've found the crazy roads here to be strangely relaxing\n- you just walk at a steady pace across a busy road and assume everyone will\nstop or go around you. Of course you look to make sure you're safe, but otherwise\npretty much relax. It's not like that on a tandem, particularly when you haven't\nridden one in a few years. Starting a tandem is often a multi-step shaky process\nwhich doesn't lend itself well to stop-start traffic with lanes that are taken\nas guidelines at best rather than hard and fast rules. Add to that the fact that\nit was night and it was pretty clear pretty quickly that we were going to have\na totally new experience of Cambodian roads. <R> This knowledge combined with the\nfact that we had just agreed to wake up at 4:30am to cycle all day in the Cambodian\nheat and I was pretty sure we were looking at the end of our relationship. </R>\n\nAfter two miles of hair-raising cycling, we'd picked up our laundry and dropped\nof our bike at our hotel. We headed out in search of dinner and ended up at a\nKhmer barbecue and soup place definitely aimed at locals. It was slightly\nbizarre, with blaring music and a Cambodian-dubbed Chinese film playing in the\nbackground. We were given a portable gas stove with a large dish on top filled\nwith soup. The centre of the dish was a hemisphere rising out of the soup with\nsmall slits to let the heat out like a grill. We were given veg to put in the\nsoup, fat and butter to put on the grill and meat covered in egg and sesame\nseeds to cook. It's also the first place we've been where we were given\nchopsticks and not a fork. It got better as the soup got stronger and one of\nthe dipping sauces that we couldn't identify (looked like tahini, but wasn't)\nwas great. <R> Nothing at this restaurant was in english at all so despite the fact\nthat it was all very tasty we're still not sure what we ate. Also the servers\ncouldn't give us any instructions so although I believe the premise of the meal is DIY\nthey ended up a doing a lot of it for us, they were lovely and very patient. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:54:58.208095	2018-10-17 17:54:58.208095	2018-02-07 10:10:00	33
34	\N	\nToday was a **long** day. We got up at 4.30am, donned helmets and head torches,\npicked up our takeaway breakfast and got on our tandem. The aim was to get to\nAngkor Wat, a huge temple and city, for sunrise. First, we needed to cycle about\nten miles to the ticket office and the national park.\n\nThe cycling was easier than the night before - much less traffic and we were\nmore accustomed to the bike. <R> Although not, as we were to learn the hard way,\naccustomed to the saddles. </R> We made reasonable time, primarily because we\ndidn't need to stop to navigate. Rosie, on the back, could check Maps.Me on her\nphone while I did all the steering. <R> I have to say Daniel is really very good\nat steering. </R> After a few bumpy roads we made it to the\nhuge moat around Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world (1.5km\nby 1.3km). It was the capital city of the Khmer Empire and has a huge temple\nat the centre and is stunning at sunrise.\n\nUnfortunately, lots of other tourists also know this. We stayed for the\nspectacular sunrise, <R> being jostled by enthusiastic asian tourists the whole\ntime, </R> then hopped back on our bike and continued to another\nruined city within the park, Angkor Thom, with another incredible temple at its\ncentre. Bayon is possibly more impressive than Angkor Wat, with a maze-like\ninterior and 37 towers all with a huge face carved onto each side. Better yet,\nas we had left so early, there weren't many other people there for most of the\ntime we were there.\n\nAs the sun came up more and more tourists arrived. The park is huge and there\nare so many impressive, ruined temples, almost all mobbed by crowds of tourists\nof all varieties. We saw people with cameras on tripods with the umbrella-like\nattachments to modify the camera's flash. We saw plenty of tourists with money\nbelts on outside their clothing (how is that useful?) and plenty more dressed to\nthe nines for all the photos they were taking. <R> I was particularly impressed\nby the woman wearing stiletto heels and a bright pick mini skirt through a mostly\nbroken down temple and the people taking their wedding pictures there. </R> We\neven saw another couple on a bright pink tandem (theirs didn't have flowers on\nthe front, though <R> they were totally jealous of the flowers </R>).\n\nThe temples were incredible. We saw one which was essentially an island on a\npond on an island in a small lake on an island in a huge resevoir only a hand\ndeep, littered with half-dead trees. Several of the gigantic temple complexes\nhave been reclaimed by the jungle, surrounded by trees. Some massive trees are\nactually growing out of the walls, looking like they have been poured onto the\nstone.\n\nWe spent the day cycling from temple to temple, ending up with sunset at a\ntemple on top of a small hill. We braved the traffic in a hectic cycle back into\nSiem Reap, dropped off the bike, had a quick dinner and fell into bed,\nshattered.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:58.565763	2018-10-17 17:54:58.565763	2018-02-07 11:20:00	34
35	\N	\nThis was our last day in Cambodia. We had took the opportunity to have a proper\nlie in (8.30am - four hours on the day before!). We had breakfast, then I spent\nquite a while writing up the last couple of days as we'd been too busy and\nexhausted to write them up on the day.\n\nOn the recommendation of our friendly and useful host, Han, we tried to go on a\nfree tour of a silk farm in the afternoon. Unfortunately, the bus was fully\nbooked, so we had a free tour of their other workshops at their Siem Reap\npremises. They had quite a few different workshops - woodwork, enamel, ceramics,\nsilver-coated bronze, and stonework among others. It was impressive to see,\nespecially after we were able to have a go at some of the stone carving. It was\npretty difficult to form any sort of regular pattern, but some of what they were\nproducing was incredibly intricate.\n\nAs it was our last day, we spent a little while shopping for a few souvenirs.\nNeither of us are that into shopping, so that didn't last that long. We headed\nback to our hotel to do a little programming and have some dinner. We got a tuk\ntuk to the airport (which was pretty slow because it got a flat tire half way\nthere).\n\nWe expected the usual airport faff not to take to long - it's not that big an\nairport. However, we'd never flown with Vietjet before. They may be cheap, but\nthey're strict. Vietnam has complicated visa rules and seems to make the\nairlines enforce them. You don't need a visa for the first 15 days, unless\nyou've been there before. To check people in, the airline officials had to\ntriple check all the stamps in their passports because apparently they'll be\nfired if they mistakenly let three people through. Needless to say, the queue\ntook a **long** time.\n\nDespite the wait, everyone seemed to make it through, including both the guy\nwho kept trying to cut his way into the line (and being rebuffed by everyone\nelse) and the British couple just getting a transfer in Vietnam who were\nforced to buy a $400 visa online before they could check in. <R> That is a very\nexpensive 2 hours. </R>\n\nThe flight itself was fine, but I could have lived without the same two songs\nbeing repeated over and over <R> you just have to embrace the cheesy pop music\nDaniel </R>. Immigration in Vietnam was a breeze - all the hard\nwork had already been done for them. We took out some money at the airport <R> \nand immediately became millionaires </R>. We got a taxi from the airport as tuk tuks\ndon't seem to be a thing here. Our hotel is fine, if noisy and a bit cold -\nHanoi is about 15 Celsius and we're used to 25 to 35. The room may have a fan\nand air con, but they're not necessary.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:59.088864	2018-10-17 17:54:59.088864	2018-02-09 21:40:00	35
36	\N	\nAfter our hotel breakfast of extra crumbly baguettes (made with rice flour and\nvery little liquid, so they're way more crumbly than French baguettes), we spent\na while looking up and booking most of the rest of our time in northern Vietnam.\n\nWe changed our plans quite a bit due to weather and some more information. We'd\nplanned to got trekking in Sapa, a mountainous area in the north, but it's going\nto be wet and almost freezing there. Instead, we're going to go to Mai Chau,\nwhich should also have scenic rice paddies and be good for walking, but be a bit\nwarmer, <R>although still pretty cold. </R>\n\nSimilarly, we planned to have a day trip to Halong Bay, a picturesque area full\nof vertical limestone islands. Instead, we're going to go to Cat Ba island for\ntwo nights. It's nearby, has similar scenery, is less touristy and has some fun\nlooking activities.\n\nAfter our booking bonanza, we headed out into Hanoi. We're staying in the Old\nQuarter - a warren of small street packed full of scooters blaring their horns\nand driving faster than they were in the other countries we've been in. Many of\nthe streets have a specialism where most of the shops sell a particular set of\ngoods, eg shoe street or sweets street. Barbecue chicken street is apparently\nvery popular. The streets have completely different names (and don't seem to\nhave signs), but you can quickly tell what everyone is selling.\n\nOne of the things we'd heard about Vietnam was that the food was great. Our\nfirst few forays into Vietnamese cuisine did not disappoint. Banh mi in\nparticular is delicious - a crusty Vietnamese baguette filled with a pork paté,\ngrilled (or better, slow cooked / roast) pork, pickle, mayo, some incredible\nsauce and maybe some chilli. We also had Vietnamese egg coffee in a waffle cone\n(although we got the chocolate version rather than coffee). Egg coffee isn't\nas weird as it sounds, it's beaten egg yolk and condensed milk, then mixed\nwith coffee (or in our case, drinking chocolate). It's creamy and sweet and\nright up my street. Apparently, it was invented during the (Vietnamese/American)\nwar when milk was expensive. <R> Its effectively a heavily beaten custard and was\nsweet and creamy enough to persuade Daniel to try coffee. </R>\n\nI also had a less pleasant food experience - getting ripped off buying what\nturned out to be not very tasty donuts. A woman was selling sweet-looking\npastries and I was interested, so she quickly filled a bag, putting in as many\nas she could fit. I'll freely admit that haggling isn't my strong point,\nespecially when somewhat rushed by the other person and in a country I've just\narrived in. I handed over the money, but knew almost immediately afterwards I\nshould have refused and only bought the amount I wanted and for a lower price.\nAh well, it was probably $4 - $5 more than it should have been, but it's a\nlesson learnt.\n\nWe spent the afternoon at the Womens' Museum and the Confucian Temple of\nLiterature. The Womens' Museum was fascinating, giving us an insight into\nmodern Vietnamese life, tribal customs, religion, the war, the rise of communism\nand independence from France. The interviews with Hanoi street vendors made me\nfeel somewhat better about being ripped off and the effects of the war on\nVietnamese life was staggering, from the tunnels built to the fact that all\nradios had to be registered with the police.\n\nBy far the best bit of the day was our evening food tour. Heavily recommended on\nTripAdvisor, we decided to book one rather than a cooking class as all the\nclasses sounded similar to the worse of the two we'd already done.\n\nThe food was fantastic and varied. We had pork meatball soup, dried beef salad,\nsteamed savoury pancakes, fried food in "Vietnamese KFC without chicken",\nnoodles, more egg coffee and banh mi, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream.\nEverything was tasty and there was just enough - I wasn't hungry and wasn't\noverly full at the end. We probably ate quite a bit over the three hours. <R> I\nwas very full and to this day I don't understand where Daniel puts it all. </R>\n\nOur guide, "Potato", was enthusiastic and informative. We learnt what was in\neach dish, how they were eaten and when. She also taught us about the dangers of\nthe Vietnamese language - the same word is used for watermelon, pineapple, and\ncoconut, just with different tones. Worse, the same is true for "thank you" and\n"shut up" (something like "come an" vs "come on"). We were a group of ten and\nshe managed to keep us together and get us all across the treacherous roads,\nthrowing her hands in the air and shouting "Sticky rice!" to group us together.\nI'm amazed it worked - it's so loud on a Hanoian street and she was tiny, even\nwith her arms raised we couldn't see her over other people.\n	2018-10-17 17:54:59.403722	2018-10-17 17:54:59.403722	2018-02-09 22:00:00	36
37	\N	\nWe started off this morning with a bit more booking stuff and starting to catch\nup on diary entries. We wandered around the Old Quarter, booking a water puppet\nshow for the evening.\n\nWe walked out of the Old Quarter to get to Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum. Almost in\nreaction to the tangle that is the Old Quarter, the streets elsewhere are really\nwide and lined with trees. According to our guide from the day before they were\nbuilt by the French. The mausoleum was imposing, but relatively simple and\nunadorned. We sat outside and happened to see the changing of the guard,\ncomplete with the slightly ridiculous march that seems to be compulsory for\nguard soldiers outside large public buildings the world over. <R> It was made\neven more entertaining by the fact that while 3 of the guards did the funny march,\na fourth stood off to the side in full dress uniform, totally not to attention and\njust aimlessly wandering around. </R>\n\nWe went back to the Old Quarter for lunch (can't get enough of those roast pork\nbanh mi). It was a great choice - we stumbled across a Japanese cream puff\npastry shop with brilliant vanilla cream that they'd inject into your choice of\npastry.\n\nThe only thing we had left to book was transport to and from the few places we\nare planning on going. We walked to a couple of travel offices to do this\n(saving some money) and decided to change our self-guided trip to Mai Chau to be\ncompletely through a tour operator. Hopefully it'll be better than in Chiang Mai\nas the tour operator has a lot of very good reviews.\n\nWe spent a while shopping in the various markets filled with silk and\ncounterfeit branded clothes. After exercising my very rudimentary haggling\nskills, I ended up with a "North Face" soft shell jacket for $15, which will be\nuseful in Vietnam and South America (assuming it lasts). Unfortunately, Rosie\ndidn't see anything she liked, but we'll be back.\n\nOne of the main things to do in Hanoi apparently is to go to a water puppet\nshow. The theatre has a large pool of water on the stage with several screens\nblocking view to the back of the stage, with musicians in the wings. Puppeteers\ncontrol large puppets in front of the stage using large poles under the water.\nThere were 14 small sketches, some impressive, some comical. One old the story\nof the tortoise lake in Hanoi, where a golden tortoise appeared to take back\na god-given sword from an ancient Vietnamese hero. The most impressive\nperformance was the dragon dance, where dragon puppets shot water and fireworks\nfrom their mouths as they dipped in and out of the water.\n\nWe walked back to the hotel through the weekend night market. We had some\ndelicious street food (deep fried noodles and beef) on the recommendation of\ntomorrow's tour operator, finished off a few diary entries and got some sleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:00.666403	2018-10-17 17:55:00.666403	2018-02-10 07:50:00	37
38	\N	\nToday was our organised, all-inclusive tour to Mai Chau. <R> These are not words\nI normally like, but having woken up with yet another case of the sniffles I was\npleased to not really have to worry about where we were doing or how we were\ngetting there </R>. Mai Chau is a\nmountainous region west of Hanoi with steep cliffs and flat flood plains covered\nin rice paddies. We were picked up by a large tourist bus in the tiny street in\nfront of our hotel in Hanoi, then, after four and a half hours, were dropped\nwith the rest of the bus load at a hotel in a town in Mai Chau.\n\nWe had lunch sitting at a table where everyone else spoke Spanish. We could\nfollow quite a lot of what was being said, but it was hard to join in. <R> We\ndid give it our best shot and they were very kind about helping us. </R> We then\nchecked in and went to our room. It seems as if we've been lucky enough to be\nmistakenly upgraded - we've got a huge room, A/C (not that it's needed), hot\nshower and decent bed when we only paid for a private room with a fan. I'm\ncertainly not complaining.\n\nWe spent the afternoon on an organised bike tour with the other 21 tourists. It\nwas slow going with that many people on mountain bikes that couldn't change gear\n(they had plenty of gears, just no gear shifters, <R> just why... </R>).\nWe cycled both on the road\nand on paths between paddies. The frequent pauses to regroup did allow us to\nadmire the scenery and for the guide to answer questions. One man was aghast\nthat they'd erected electricity pylons in the valley because it spoilt the\nview for tourists. He'd rather they bury the electric cables underneath the\nflooded rice paddies, apparently. <R> He later asked if the small hut that we\nstopped at to buy traditional weavings had a card machine, so I'm not convinced\nhe really thought things through before he said them. </R>\n\nWe had a buffet dinner and then watched some local dancing. There were a few\naudience participation dances at the end, one involving drinking rice wine and\nanother where several people brought large bamboo poles on the ground together\nand apart while everyone else tried to step through without getting their feet\ncaught. <R> Once again I was quite glad to be on an "all-inclusive" thing, there\nis no way I could have got Daniel to go to a local dance without it. Also they\nmade me some ginger tea which was just smashed ginger, hot water, and a little\nbit of honey. My sore throat felt so much better, it was amazing.</R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:02.296737	2018-10-17 17:55:02.296737	2018-02-10 21:50:00	38
39	\N	\nWe woke up in our "deluxe" room and had a buffet breakfast of fruit, pancakes\nand plenty of deep-fried rice flour donuts. The activity for the day was\nclimbing 1,200 steps up to a limestone cave, so after breakfast about 15 of our\ngroup cycled into the main town to the base of the steps.\n\nThe view as we climbed was impressive - a completely flat valley floor with\nsharp limestone peaks jutting up 400m, fading into cloud. The cave was filled\nwith massive stalagmites and smaller stalactites. Apparently an old man had\nlived there until 2002, when it had been opened to tourists.\n\nAfter a brief look at the local markets, we cycled back for lunch. We were then\ntold that we were actually leaving at 2pm rather than 3pm, so had less than an\nhour of free time. That cut short the time we'd planned to spend cycling by\nourselves to do a bit more exploring - we only really had time to go to a tour\noffice to check the details of our next trip. However, when we arrived back at\n2pm, we ended up sitting at reception until after 3pm. Grumble. <R> Double Grumble. </R>\n\nAfter another four hours on a bus, we were back in Hanoi. We'd managed to just\nfinish the second last book of the Wheel of Time and were ready for dinner. We\nended up with some lacklustre banh mi, but made up for them with more delicious\ncream puffs from the Japanese "beard papa" cream puff stall.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:03.17636	2018-10-17 17:55:03.17636	2018-02-12 08:15:00	39
152	\N	The breakfast at our hotel was **huge**, including bowls of tea and hot\nchocolate (you can probably guess who had tea and who had chocolate).\n\nWe took a taxi up the road to the "tarabita" - a metal box suspended on a wire\nacross a canyon, powered by an old car engine. Along with four or five others,\nwe took it across the 150m drop to get to the walking path on the other side.\nWe followed the trail to five of the seven nearby waterfalls, avoiding getting\ntoo wet. None of them were massive, but still picturesque.\n\nWe took the tarabita back, then were offered a lift back down to town by a\nlocal. Back down the hill we had some arepas for lunch, then made it back to\nthe hotel just before the rain really started. Stuck inside, we ended up\nwatching several episodes of the crime series Castle (Nathan Fillion is\ngreat). Once the rain died down enough, we ventured out to find a highly rated\n(but empty) Italian restaurant for dinner, then watched a bit more Castle.\n	2018-10-17 17:56:01.95613	2018-10-17 17:56:01.95613	2018-06-22 11:30:00	152
40	\N	\nWe were only back in Hanoi for a night - this morning we had an early bus out to\nthe coast. I tried to get breakfast before the 7.45am bus, leaving our hotel to\nbuy banh mi before 7am. There's one particular tiny banh mi shop, Bami Bread,\nthat we've been back to a few times because the sandwiches are the best.\nBrilliant sauce, perfect paté, an excellent pickle - I may be addicted, <R> he is. </R>\nI actually arrived too early, they hadn't opened yet. It was strange to see the\nroads so empty and the pavements no longer covered in stalls, scooters, and\npeople. I came back a little later, got a couple of delicious warm baguettes,\nthen caught our bus from our hotel.\n\nThe bus was pretty fancy - it had wifi, <R> (not good wifi, but wifi) </R>\nwhich is a first for the buses we've had here. We had a ticket all the way to\nCat Ba island, a large island two buses and\none boat away from Hanoi. Cat Ba is in an area of huge numbers of limestone\nkarsts, shear islands jutting out of jade sea.\n\nDespite the cloud and haze, we got some excellent views of the area from an old\ncannon fort above Cat Ba town, used in both WWII and the Vietnam war. We spent\nthe afternoon there and walking between some of the beaches near the town. We\nbooked our activities for the next day and had dinner at a rooftop restaurant.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:04.013365	2018-10-17 17:55:04.013365	2018-02-13 21:40:00	40
41	\N	\nToday was fantastic. The main reason for coming to Cat Ba was to see the\nlimestone karst landscape, which we had ample opportunity to do. Cat Ba is near\nLan Ha bay, which is a maze of shear-cliffed islands, hidden lagoons and\nfloating villages. It's just south of the better-known Halong Bay, but\napparently the same landscape, less polluted and with fewer tourists.\n\nWe had booked a tour with a highly-rated adventure tour company, Asia Outdoors,\nto go kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. After a short bus journey from\ntheir office, we piled into a large-ish boat (an old junk) along with about 15\nothers heading out kayaking and climbing. We chatted with a few people as\nclimbers were dropped off and had about an hour's journey to our kayak spot.\n\nWe were in a group of five with two guides, almost everyone being from the UK or\nIreland. There was a father and son from England and an Irish guy who'd just\nquit his job and was traveling before a career change. Our guides seemed like\nseasoned travelers, one of whom was aiming to teach sustainable adventure\ntourism in New Zealand, but struggling with visa regulations. It was a fun\ngroup as everyone was reasonably laid back.\n\nThe scenery was stunning even if there was no sign of the sun and it was a tad\ncold. The tide was really low, so the eroded undersides of all the islands were\nexposed. Each island had an overhang several metres deep all the way around it\ncaused both by the sea and the huge numbers of large barnacles visible on the\nrock that would normally be underwater. Along the water's edge were all sorts\nof little caves and archways where the stone had eroded in odd patterns. These\nalso occurred on a large scale too - we kayaked under several arches and into\ntwo lagoons almost invisible from the outside. Once, we got out of the kayaks\ninto what could have been the mouth of a cave, except inside there was no\nceiling, just walls of rock at least 50 metres high on all sides.\n\nIt was a brilliant morning. We took it slowly, following our guide and paddling\nbetween the islands. It's a disorientating landscape - without a guide we would\neasily have become lost. The rocks were sharp, the water often shallow and\nsome passages very narrow, so we had to try quite hard to have fine control over\nthe motion of the kayak to get in and out of lagoons. <R> Fortunately by this point\nDaniel and I are were experienced kayakers by this point, much to the relief of\nour guide who I think was concerned that we were going to have argument mid way\nround the bay. According to him kayaking is a make it or break it moment for most\ncouples. </R>\n\nAfter kayaking, we returned to the boat, which then picked up all the climbers.\nWe also dropped off two staff members at "party island" which the staff were\nall disparaging about. It's a group of fairly plush huts and a bar on one of the\nislands, all built on a beach of imported sand. The owners have a deal with the\ntour company to provide some climbing instruction as an activity. The\ninstructors end up having to decide whether the people they're helping have had\ntoo much to drink to be allowed to climb. <R> It sounds horrendous. </R>\n\nThe boat crew prepared us a delicious lunch - similar fare to what we'd had in\nMai Chau, but so much better. Rice, surprisingly good potatoes, battered fish\nand great spring rolls (deep-fried, of course). The boat crew were all locals\nand lived on the boat, shouting to each other in Vietnamese. The guides were all\nEuropean, Australian or American, as were the tourists, and the two groups\nseemed to coexist without really interacting except for lunch.\n\nAfter eating, we headed back out towards where we'd kayaked to do some paddle\nboarding. As we were on our way, the clouds burned off and we got some great\nviews of the black and white cliffs against the emerald sea.\n\nWe were paddle boarding with the Irish guy we'd kayaked with and a couple from\nSeattle. Our guide was from Edinburgh but had been out here for seven months.\nPaddle boarding in the sun was excellent - it would have been worth coming here\njust for the morning's kayaking, but the paddle boarding was even better. We saw\nhundreds of underwater baskets used to farm oysters in the shallower water. The\nwater was so low the we both got our boards' fins caught in the baskets at some\npoint, but it was so calm that we could easily rectify the problem. As well as\nenjoying the scenery we also collected some plastic waste that floated past us\nwhich Asia Outdoors would recycle.\n\nWe paddled past plenty of floating homes and floating villages. These are little\nsheds on anchored platforms surrounded by fish farms and often with several dogs\nprowling along the walkways, ready to bark at strangers. There weren't many\nother tourist boats, but some of the local boats were pretty odd. One was made\nfrom concrete and had been converted into a house with brick walls, anchored\nabout 20m off shore.\n\nHaving had a terrific day, we got back to Cat Ba town about 5.30pm. We had a bit\nof trouble finding dinner due to Tet (Vietnamese lunar new year), which is in a\nfew days. The first restaurant we tried, which had been recommended, was shut.\nThe second was only doing pizza and didn't have all the ingredients yet. We\nended up at an ok place with decent pancakes - a necessity on pancake Tuesday.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:04.528708	2018-10-17 17:55:04.528708	2018-02-14 15:00:00	41
42	\N	\nThe slight problem with Cat Ba is that there isn't much to do (that we're\ninterested in) besides the bay. There's a national park, but it's a scooter ride\naway from town and neither of us were keen to ride one - we'd seen enough people\nwith evidence of scooter accidents on them. It would have been a difficult cycle\non poor quality bikes and the few places that had decent reviews for guided\ntours weren't running any today because of Tet. We therefore changed our bus\nfrom later in the afternoon to earlier to get a bit more time in Hanoi.\n\nHanoi was heaving, today is apparently the last normal day before the Tet\nholiday, so everyone is busy buying stuff. We joined in, getting Rosie a soft\nshell jacket (she's jealous of mine). <R> It just looked so comfy, also where else\ncan you get a totally genuine north face jacket for $15. </R>  We also had some more\ncream puffs (I need to learn to make choux pastry, it seems like a great way to\ndisguise that you're basically just eating cream).\n\nThe real high point of today was the food. First, we stumbled upon a stall\nselling freshly baked "rotiboy" - a soft bread bun with a crispy top and\nmelted butter on the inside. Apparently they originate from Malaysia, where they\nare called Mexican coffee buns and have a crispy coffee topping. I had a vanilla\none and it was exquisite.\n\nWe managed to find a pub with a range of stouts that Rosie enjoyed, then headed\nto an interesting-looking restaurant which had pork with caramel sauce on the\nmenu. I'd heard that this was a Vietnamese dish and was looking forward to\ntrying it. It did not disappoint. Slow-cooked meat full of flavour, dripping\nwith a small amount of rich, sweet sauce, a few slices of chilli and spring\nonion with several braised quails' eggs. Different and delicious.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:05.106141	2018-10-17 17:55:05.106141	2018-02-14 21:30:00	42
43	\N	\nWe both woke up a bit sick today. Rosie's been sick on and off for the last four\nweeks - apparently it's spreading. Either that or it's smog-related - we met a\nfew people who said they got sore throats after arriving in Hanoi. Or I could\nbe allergic to early mornings as I got up at 6.30am to try and find breakfast\n(and returned empty handed - sadly the rotiboy place wasn't open).\n\nWe had an early-ish flight to Ho Chi Minh City, so got a taxi to the airport.\nAs we weren't leaving the country it was a pretty smooth experience. Transport\nfrom the airport, however, was not. It's Tet tomorrow, so lots of things may or\nmay not be open or running. The taxi drivers, unsurprisingly, were insistent\nthat the buses weren't running. They, however, are pretty notorious for scamming\ntourists and we were reluctant to believe them. There didn't seem to be many\nbuses around, but Rosie asked an official who then called a bus company who said\nthey were running. After about 30 minutes we saw a bus and waved to hail it. The\ndriver waved back and drove on. Sigh. We waited for another 20 minutes, then\ngave up and got an Uber.\n\nIt was lucky we ended up in an Uber as our hotel turned out to be in a maze of\nalleyways off one of the main backpacker party streets. If he hadn't called the\nhotel to get directions, it would have taken us ages to find.\n\nOnce we got there we ended up waiting along with another guy for our rooms to be\ncleaned. He was originally Vietnamese, but lived in Seattle. <R> He was really\ninteresting to talk to and told us all about his life. It was almost like getting\na locals perspective on Vietnam although he has lived most of his life in the west\nso I imagined that coloured his view of the country. He told us what his family\nthought about Communism, Americans, and where the country was headed. </R> I was pretty hungry\nby the time we got into our room, so we dropped off our bags and headed out to\nget something to eat.\n\nWe chose somewhere nearby and ordered more of the caramelized pork cooked in a\nclay pot. Pretty soon after ordering, a drunken English expat butted into our\nconversation. He was with a (sober) Irish expat, who was clearly embarrassed by\nhis friend and jumped into the conversation as damage control after a few\nboorish comments from the first guy. We had an odd meal, learning bits about\nexpat life in Vietnam from the Irish guy with occasional drunken additions from\nthe English guy, eg claiming he fought in the Vietnam war (which was immediately\nrefuted by the Irish guy). <R> I did not like the English guy and decided fairly\nearly on that he didn't like me either (apparently because I said ya instead of yes).\nHe even told Daniel that he shouldn't date me, what a guy.\n\nSlightly bemused, we went back to our hotel to try and plan what to do in\nMalaysia, which is still a bit up in the air. We ended up with enough of a plan\nto book flights, but were defeated by Air Asia's website refusing to cooperate.\n\nToday was the last day of the lunar year, so while we had dinner at a small\nrestaurant several people playing a drum and dancing in a dragon costume came\nthrough the alley outside multiple times. Around 11pm, we made our way to a\nbridge to see the New Year fireworks display. We were in a large crowd of people\nand scooters (of course), but managed to get a spot with a decent view. There\nwas a spectacular display at midnight for a good 15 minutes, accompanied by\nvarious members of the crowd lighting sparkler cannons and giant, metre-long\nparty poppers filled with bits of golden foil. Spectacular, but there was a huge\namount of rubbish on the ground as we made our way back to the hotel.\n\nHappy year of the dog!\n	2018-10-17 17:55:05.540054	2018-10-17 17:55:05.540054	2018-02-16 20:50:00	43
44	\N	\nAfter our late night (1am!), we had a late morning lie in (10am). Today was\npretty relaxed, partly due to not that much being on. We tried to find a decent\nbreakfast place, but the recommended ones were shut. I ended up getting a rice\nporridge with pork, which I was intrigued to try but wasn't surprised when it\nwasn't anything special.\n\nAfter a similar experience at lunch, we went to the War Remnants Museum, one of\nthe few places still open. They have a large number of American military\nvehicles on display outside which were used in the war. Inside, it's a\nthree-story building dedicated to Vietnamese independence and unification,\nfocusing mainly on the horrific things done to the Vietnamese by the USA (and\nsomewhat by the French). It's definitely a one-sided take on events, but the\nphotography exhibition coupled with descriptions of how the photographers died\nand the pictures of the genetic defects caused by Agent Orange were terrible\nand sobering. In particular, it'll be hard to forget the picture of the woman\nborn without eyeballs.\n\nHaving got one side of the story, we spent some time during and after dinner\nlooking up more about the war to try and get more of a full picture.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:05.982552	2018-10-17 17:55:05.982552	2018-02-16 22:10:00	44
45	\N	\nWe had a pretty lazy day today, getting up late and going for brunch at a\nsandwich place that had only taken a couple of days off for Tet. We spent the\nafternoon in a large park with impressive flower displays (and some fish in\ntanks?). Unfortunately, similar to yesterday's lunch, attempted to find\nsomewhere decent for dinner, were thwarted by Tet opening times and ended up\nsomewhere a bit disappointing for the price.\n\nAs we walked through the city throughout the day we encountered various different\ngroups of people involved in, presumably, Tet-related celebrations. While trying\nto find dinner we found ourselves in a large crowd of people milling around in a\nbig square - I'm not really sure what was going on. On our way back from dinner\nwe went into an outdoor performance area where someone was singing in Vietnamese\naccompanied by four dancers, then was replaced by a dancing troupe singing &\ndancing to "If you're happy and you know it clap your hands" in Vietnamese. All\nthe children in the audience were called up beforehand and given basic dance\nmoves to do as well.\n\nThe best performance we stumbled across was a group of men playing music,\nparticularly drums, while holding up a bamboo pole about seven metres high with\na small bar as a foothold just below the top. Another man in a dragon costume\nclimbed the pole and proceeded to dance to the music. Towards the end none of\nhis hands or feet were on the pole - he spun himself around, balancing his chest\non the top of the pole. He did this while wearing a massive dragon costume\nwhich covered his head and dangled below his feet.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:06.383724	2018-10-17 17:55:06.383724	2018-02-17 21:30:00	45
46	\N	\nOur last full day in Ho Chi Minh City started reasonably early as we were\ngetting picked up at 8am. We learnt that apparently very few of the restaurants\non the main backpacker streets near where we're staying open before 8am, so\nended up with a pretty meagre breakfast.\n\nThe day's activity was visiting the Cu Chi tunnels. These are a massive network\nof underground tunnels outside the city, up to 10 metres below the surface and\napparently there's over 120km of them. The Viet Cong hid in them during\nbombings, lived in parts of them and used them during attacks to surprise their\nenemies.\n\nThe tunnels themselves are pretty claustrophobic - 1 metre high and less than\nthat in width, you can either crawl or just about walk stooped over and bending\nyour knees. These tunnels had also been increased in size to these dimensions\nfor tourists and had some lighting and ventilation added. The originals must\nhave been awful. <R> I had a minor panic attack when the guide pretended to trap\nme in one of them and I thought I had gotten stuck, they were very small. </R>\n\nIn addition to the tunnels themselves, we watched a Vietnamese propaganda film\nfrom the sixties about Cu Chi and saw a wide variety of unpleasant traps used to\nmaim and kill unwitting enemies. There were even gunshots to be heard in the\nbackground as there's a shooting range on site where tourists can fire guns from\nthe time of the war. <R> The constant sound of gunfire probably made the place\nfeel more realistic but was very loud when you were anywhere near the gun range. </R>\n\nAt the end, we learnt a bit about the food the Viet Cong ate. I'm sure they had\nsome rice, but they also apparently had tapioca / cassava, which we were able to\ntry. It's pretty tasteless boiled by itself, but we were given sugar and ground\npeanuts to dip it in, which I doubt is authentic. Tasty, though. We were shown\nthe chimneys for cookfires, deliberately designed to disperse the smoke to look\nlike mist rising from the jungle in the early morning to disguise it.\n\nWe spent the afternoon wandering through the city, seeing the cathedral and\nstumbling upon another Tet celebration - a dragon dance on the street. We had\na bit more caramelized pork (it's just so good) and had some decent\nMediterranean food at a busy four-floored restaurant. It was oddly organised,\nwith a kitchen on the ground and top floors, bread made downstairs and\neverything else upstairs, forcing the wait staff to spend all their time racing\nup and down the stairs. <R> The poor members of staff must have legs of steel,\none guy in particular could climb 4 flights of stairs, 2 steps at a time at a\ndead run. It was pretty impressive. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:06.856502	2018-10-17 17:55:06.856502	2018-02-18 22:10:00	46
47	\N	\n**Note** I'm writing this about a week afterwards - due to a few long days and a\nslight issue with a leaking water bottle and wet computer, I haven't written in\na while.\n\nThis was another traveling day, this time with an early afternoon flight to\nPenang in Malaysia. This could have ended up meaning the morning was a\nwrite-off, but instead we actually made use of it. It turned out that one of\nRosie's family friends was getting a boat built in Ho Chi Minh City, so we went\nto see it in the factory. <R> Thanks Bill. </R> We had to be there by 9am, so we\ngrabbed a couple of small banh mi from a street stall - bread rolls 30cm long\nand 3cm in diameter filled with paté.\n\nThe factory was outside of the centre, so it was lucky it was still Tet -\napparently the traffic is normally terrible. We arrived outside a warehouse\nwhich clearly contained some boats and a guy ran up to us and started talking in\nVietnamese. Rosie asked repeatedly if he was Mike, the guy we were meeting, and\nhe said "Yes", but then seemed to say that to anything we asked. He brought us\nto another guy and eventually into an office where we met Mike, a guy probably\nin his thirties or forties from Kent, with an Australian accent who had been\nliving here for the last four years. He showed us around several of the twenty\nor so catamarans in one of their warehouses at different stages in the\nproduction line. It was fascinating to see the two fibreglass halves of the\nboats - the moulds must be huge as the boats are over 40 feet long. We climbed\ninto a boat where the top had already been attached to the hull and into another\nwhere more of the amenities had been installed.\n\nWe also learnt quite a bit from Mike about living in Vietnam and how it had\nchanged while he had been there. He recommended seeing the country by bike,\nwhich could easily be another trip. He also said that Ho Chi Minh City is\ngrowing rapidly but that quite a bit of this is due to corruption. Apparently\nit's legal to buy property in cash, so it's an easy way to clean money. He said\nthat government officials probably get paid between $20,000 and $40,000, but\nsome drive Mercedes costing around $500,000 (taking into account the 220% import\ntax).\n\nAfter our visit, we headed back to our guest house, checked out and found some\nlunch. We took another Grab car (South East Asian Uber) to the airport to get\nour plane (it was much easier to leave Vietnam than enter it). The flight was\nfine, but was fumigated at the end as part of Malaysian regulations. <R> There\nwas also some pretty serious turbulence on the way in. I don't think I've been\non a flight where multiple people screamed at the same time before. </R> We landed\non the island of Penang and took a bus to Georgetown. The buses are branded\n"rapidPenang", but don't quite live up to their name.\n\nAfter checking in (and getting a tiny box room with close to paper walls), we\nheaded out for dinner. Both starving, we didn't spend too long looking and\nquickly settled down at a nearby Indian restaurant. As we were right beside\nlittle India, most of the restaurants were Indian. We had a fantastic meal for\nvery little money - great curries, naan, chapati and dosa (or "tosai" here).\nAll of the bread came with dips, so we were stuffed by the end.\n\nAfter dinner, we decided to catch a bus to a large Chinese temple recommended by\nthe guy working at our hotel. Because it was Chinese New Year, the entire\ncomplex had been covered with lanterns and lights similar to Christmas lights.\nIt's up on a hill, so was visible from quite a distance from our bus. The\ntraffic near it was so bad that we ended up getting out of the bus and walking.\nWe had a whistle-stop tour as it was 10.30pm and the buses stopped somewhere\nbetween 11 and 11.30pm. The temple was spectacular, but mobbed with people.\nAfterwards, we spent quite a while trying to get a bus back, especially as we\nweren't 100% sure which bus we needed. One going our way finally arrived and we\nmade it to sleep about 1am. It didn't feel quite as late as that because,\ndespite flying two hours primarily west, we've actually gone forward one hour.\nDamn timezones.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:07.523752	2018-10-17 17:55:07.523752	2018-02-25 12:00:00	47
48	\N	\nDue to our late night, we ended up getting up pretty late (10.30am - 11am). We\nhad breakfast at a local bakery (cheese and banana sandwiches are popular here),\nthen did some trip admin jobs - post a few things, get some laundry done. By\nmidday it was **hot** - it's been 34 degrees elsewhere, but I swear it felt\nhotter here. We decided against walking up the hills nearby and instead spent\nthe day wandering through Georgetown to see the local street art, both murals\nand wire sculptures.\n\nWalking around the town showed us how different Malaysia is from the countries\nwe've been to so far. For one thing, the roads are filled mainly with cars, not\nscooters, and you are supposed to cross at traffic lights, not just walk blindly\ninto the road. Surprisingly, I found myself missing Vietnamese roads - walking\ndirectly into the road just seems faster and easier.\n\nAnother difference is the language - Vietnamese and Thai are tonal, so were\nvery difficult for me to pronounce. Even though Vietnamese used the Latin\nalphabet, it had plenty of additional symbols to indicate tones. Malay isn't\ntonal, uses the Latin alphabet, is pronounced the way it is written and has many\nfamiliar words, eg "restoran" is restaurant.\n\nA further difference is the money. So far, all the denominations have been\npretty huge, eg in Vietnam the smallest note is 1,000 dong and we'd spend over\na million a day. Malaysian ringgit are only four to the dollar, so we're back\nto having ones and tens. <R> There are even a couple of coins, although i think\nthe smallest denomination is 5 sent. </R>\n\nAnyway, back to the day at hand, we followed another recommendation from our\nhotel and went to the snake temple for the evening. As part of Chinese New Year\nthey had a festival with some sore of fire display later on that night. The\ntemple itself does have live snakes living in it, some hanging on wire circles\non the columns inside (above head height), others in a walled garden outside.\nThe internet assured us that "most of them have been defanged".\n\nWe indulged at the various food stalls, trying a variety of (mainly deep fried)\nfoods, then sat to watch the main stage. At 7.30pm, people started giving\nspeeches, thanking everyone involved in the organisation. 45 minutes and four\nspeakers later, after everyone involved and all the attending politicians had\nbeen thanked sufficiently in Chinese and English, some performances started.\nThere were drummers, several singers and multiple groups of dancers. The most\nimpressive were a group with a very long, thin paper-like dragon suspended\nabove them on poles. They rotated the poles while walking, making the dragon\nappear to swirl through the air. At times they would have to jump over the\ndragon in a staggered line.\n\nAfter several hours, around 9pm, we decided waiting until midnight was going to\nbe too much. We had a bit more of a look around. We saw some more dragon\ndancers, this time in large dragon costumes covering two people each, pretending\nto fight on raised platforms and throwing oranges to the crowd. We saw several\ngymnasts, one specialising in balancing things on sticks held between his teeth,\neg catching basketballs thrown by the crowd on this stick, then holding a spoon\nin his mouth with a spatula spinning on it with a bowl spinning on the spatula.\nRidiculous, but impressive.\n\nAs we left, it began to rain. By the time we found shelter, it was torrential.\nWe were glad to have left when we did, as in the few seconds it took to get into\nthe Grab car we ordered we were close to soaked. <R> P.S. Places that offer\nfree internet with no password, you're the best. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:07.95667	2018-10-17 17:55:07.95667	2018-02-25 12:30:00	48
49	\N	\nUnfortunately we ended up getting up pretty late. After another recommendation,\nwe got breakfast at a Dim Sum place nearby. The food was great; a wide variety\nof things appearing on trolleys, few of which we recognised. We ate quite a bit,\n but, like my time in China, the food is so different that I ended up feeling\n slightly odd and stopped eating before I was full.\n\nTo beat the heat of the day, we took the funicular railway up Penang Hill\n(according to the internet it has the steepest tunnel in the world). There,\nit was a bit cooler, but pretty busy. We went on one of the larger walks, then\nwalked down the steep road and paths (at times, 30%) down to the botanical\ngardens at the base of the hill.\n\nAlong the walks, we came across multiple groups of two different types of\nmonkey. One set were dark brown with light patches around their eyes, except\nfor a tiny, bright orange baby. They were pretty chilled, sitting at the tops of\ntrees eating something, with the occasional wild leap between trees. <R> These\nwere the nice monkeys and the little ginger one was adorable. </R>\n\nThe other monkeys were quite different. Light grey-brown with a ginger tinge to\ntheir backs (apart from dark brown babies), they were more interested in people.\nThey were normally close to or on the\nground and let us take photos, but after a while and for no discernible reason\nall became aggressive and ran at us. They stopped just before getting to us, but\nwe left the area pretty sharpish. <R> Evil little monkeys. </R>\n\nDown at the botanics it was pretty hot again. We were tired and hungry, but saw\nour bus pull out of the car park as we arrived. We sprinted to the next stop and\nmanaged to catch it, only to be told that it was going to wait there for another\nhalf an hour. Not content to wait, we walked on, got some drinks (they still\nhave Vanilla Coke here) and found another bus.\n\nWe had a more expensive dinner - a French-inspired Malaysian restaurant with\nenticing pastries and a great salad. We picked up some of the pastries for\nour breakfast the next day, too.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:08.626	2018-10-17 17:55:08.626	2018-02-25 13:40:00	49
115	\N	We made our morning flight to Santa Cruz, despite a badly-calculated morning\nalarm, miscalculated amount of time to get to the airport and (initially)\nslow taxi driver. The flight was short, but came with free dried fruit (which\nwas a bit weird). <R> I politely asked the taxi driver to go a little more\nquickly and off he went as fast as his little car could go (which was still\nnot very fast). </R>\n\nOur taxi dropped us off at a dingy hostel and neither of us had particularly\ngreat first impressions of Santa Cruz. Most of what there is to do here is get\ntours of the nearby national parks and we learnt today that most of those\ntour operators don't open at the weekends (ie, while we're here) - maybe this\nwas a bit of a mistake. Ah well.\n\nWe had lunch out, then spent the afternoon trying to get the diary back on\ntrack. It is woefully behind (multiple weeks). We had dinner at yet another\ndeserted restaurant (we seem to eat at the wrong time). The star of the show\nwas a tricolour gnocchi - made with three different colours of potatoes rather\nthan dyed with spinach, beetroot or squid ink as I've seen before. <R> They\nwere delicious and definetly something I am going to try at home, althought I'm\nnot sure where I'm going to get three such different types of potatoes from. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:37.610479	2018-10-17 17:55:37.610479	2018-04-29 23:30:00	115
50	\N	\nAfter only a couple of nights in Georgetown, we were off again, this time to the\nCameron Highlands. Famous for its tea production, this was one of the places\nRosie had been looking forward to in particular. <R> Tea is the best!! </R>\nIt was another long bus journey, starting out over one of the huge bridges to the\nmainland. Highlight of the morning: at our ten minute mid-trip stop, the cafe in\nthe station served fresh rotiboys (the delicious butter-filled rolls we found in\nVietnam). Low point: due to a leak, my small bag was soaked, including my computer\n(it was fine after drying for a day or two).\n\nAfter checking in to our hotel (with an even smaller box room than the previous\nplace), we went in search of tea. Or rather, Rosie did, and I tagged along for\nsome food. In addition to tea, the Cameron Highlands produce a lot of fruit and\nveg, particularly strawberries. Therefore, tea, scones and strawberry jam are\navailable from a lot of places. We had tea and scones (and a lassi for me), but\nunfortunately none were quite as good as we were hoping. <R> Unfortunately the\nscones were just a little bit stale, although they were warm, and the tea tasted\nonly slightly better than Tesco own brand tea. </R>\n\nWith a little bit of the day left, we had a short walk to a nearby waterfall.\nThere are plenty of signposted walking trails around Tanah Rata (the main town),\nso it was easy enough to find a short walk. We turned around pretty early\nbecause it was supposed to bucket down.\n\nFor dinner, we ended up getting curry in a bread bowl. A large proportion of\nthe local population are of southern Indian descent, originally brought by the\nBritish as labourers for the plantations. Because of this, there is a plethora\nof decent Indian food, which we had quite a bit of.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:09.095524	2018-10-17 17:55:09.095524	2018-02-25 14:00:00	50
51	\N	\n<R> The forecast for today was supposed to be very very wet in the afternoon.\nAs such we got up fairly early and went to have breakfast. TripAdvisor had\nsuggested that the pancakes at a street food stall run by a hearing-impaired\ncouple were very good so we wandered over there to check them out.  I had a\nstrawberry and Daniel had banana (surprising, I thought Daniel didn’t like\nbananas). The pancakes were good and the woman was very nice, even teaching us\nsome sign language however the one disappointment was the tea. Thus far in South\nEast Asia I have ordered my tea black, however yesterday when I had ordered tea\nit had come with a little jug of milk and so I thought that ordering tea with\nmilk would be safe in the Cameron Highlands. Not so, my tea with milk was 4/5th\ntea and a full 1/5th condensed milk, I was sad.\n\nAfter breakfast we packed a bag with waterproofs (just in case) and headed over\nto the taxi rank to get a taxi to one of the closer tea plantations called the\nCameron valley plantation. On the way we saw some spectacular views of tea\nplantations with patches of dark green and light green leaves where the tea had\nbeen harvested and not yet been harvested respectively. At the tea plantation\nwe ordered some of their tea to drink (it had to be done) in part to make up for\nthe breakfast tea however I was sorely disappointed yet again. Instead of a pot\nwith tea leaves or even a tea bag we were served tea that had been made probably\n20 minutes ago and had been standing at just below boiling for the last 20\nminutes. As such it tasted slightly stale and overly bitter, it was most similar\nto the type of tea they serve at conferences where the plenary lecture over ran\nby 10 minutes.\n\nHowever, the view from the tea shop was fantastic and we even saw a hawk\nwheeling about above the fields of tea before it was mobbed by a crow (Chapter\n6 - Talons and Tea Leaves). The plan was to walk back to town first through the\ntea plantations and then up through the jungle paths. We set of and soon\nrealized that the Cameron Highlands are hilly, very hilly. As such the people\nhave terraced every spare acre not planted with tea (which does not need to be\nterraced) and planted an extreme variety of fruits and vegetables. We walked\nthrough fields of beans, peas, cabbages and some vines with a type of gourd\nlooking thing on them which neither of us recognized.\n\nWhen we were far enough away from the tea plantations so as not get told off,\nDaniel decided to get out his drone and see if he could get any good shots of\nthe terraces. We spent about 10 minutes playing around with the drone but\nunfortunately the wind was too strong, the hill too steep, and we were too\nuseless to be able to get any decent shots. We carried on up the hill as the\nterraces turned to jungle and the sky turned to cloud and then we were in the\ncloud and in the jungle. We continued upwards and forwards along what we were\n90% sure was the path although we had to do a fair amount of bush whacking and\nmany of these bushes whacked back. The path got very steep at points, to the\npoint that we had to give each other a boost up, but was always manageable and\nwe were very glad that it was not raining.\n\nAlong the path we saw many pitcher plants which looked very cool as well as an\nenormous stag beetle the body of which was probably the same size as a salt\nshaker (like the type you would find in a canteen) but with legs and horns. We\ngot to the top of the hill (by going up, and up some more) and then headed back\ndown along a much better path towards the town. When we were about 30 minutes\nfrom the hotel the promised rain started and we barely had time to get\nwaterproofs on before the heavens really opened. The path turned into a small\nriver and we squelched our way down it getting to a tarmac road just as the rain\nstopped. Everything not covered by the coat was soaking by the time the rain\nstopped less than 15 minutes later.\n\nDespite now being very very wet we were also very very hungry and so went in\nsearch of lunch where I sampled some Malaysian Guinness, apparently it’s the\nbest Guinness in the world after Ireland. I thought it was good but a bit\nstrong. After lunch we headed back to the hotel to shower and try and dry our\nclothes. It's difficult to dry anything in a room that is only just big enough\nto hold two beds and two people especially when quite a lot of Daniel's stuff\nwas still wet from yesterday but we did our best. After showers Daniel worked\non the website a bit and then we went for dinner and tried to get a somewhat\nearly night. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:09.716011	2018-10-17 17:55:09.716011	2018-02-25 14:00:00	51
52	\N	\n<R> Nothing had quite dried when we woke before the sun (5:50am) with the hope\nof seeing the sunrise over the tea plantations. As such I put on slightly wet\ntrousers and slightly wet shoes and packed a slightly wet coat into a slightly\nwet backpack. Our guide picked us up outside our </R> (slightly wet) <R>\nhotel and manged to strike a difficult balance of being enthusiastic about the\nmorning to come without being so chipper as to be annoying. I was impressed,\nit’s a hard balance to achieve.\n\nHe drove us in a slightly beaten up Landrover (in British green no less) up a\nfairly bumpy to a view point where we waited in the steadily retreating darkness\nhoping that the clouds would lift and we would get to see the sun. According to\nAppu (the guide) it’s pretty much impossible to predict if you will see the\nsunrise or not but he showed us some pictures of it and it looked incredible.\nApparently, what you need is for it to rain hard for 15 minutes and then the\nclouds will lift and your lost sleep will not be in vain. Unfortunately for us\na light misting was all we got and the sun rose without ever showing itself\nbehind the clouds. As we returned to town we got to talking to Appu who told us\nthat he considered himself Indian despite being third generation Malaysian.\nApparently the three cultures (the Malay, the Chinese and the Indian\npopulations) are fairly segregated in everyday life having different traditions,\ndifferent languages and even different schools. I found this particularly\ninteresting given that even though I was born to British parents and have lived\nin the UK for 30% of my life I wouldn’t wholly consider myself British while\nthis man who has never lived in India, born to parents who have never lived in\nIndia considers himself Indian.\n\nAppu dropped us off a great place to get some breakfast after which we were\npicked up by another guide Kali who had a white Landrover this time. After being\non a couple of disappointing guided tours we once again had been reluctant to\nsign up for this one but you can’t get 340 5 stars reviews on TripAdvisor\nwithout being somewhat decent and Kali exceeded all expectations. He first took\nus to the </R> (Scottish-owned) <R> BOH tea plantation where he explained the\nprocess of making the 4 different types of tea (Black, Chinese, Green, and\nWhite). The process goes as follows:\n\nBlack, Chinese, and Green tea:\n\n* The top layer of leaves are picked, this used to be done by hand but is now done by a machine\n* These leaves are dried for 48 hours which mainly removes the moisture on the outside of the leaves\n* The leaves are then rolled to break up the leaves and remove the stalks and stems, again this used to be done by hand but is now done by a machine, the machine at this particular factory was made in Belfast which we found amusing\n* The leaves are then left to oxidize on aluminium trays for different amounts of time\n  * Black tea is left for 3 hours\n  * Chinese tea is left for 1 hour\n  * Green tea is not oxidized\n* The leaves are then further dried and are sorted by size for packaging\n* The smaller leaves go into tea bags and the larger leaves are used for loose leaf tea or pyramid tea bags.\n* The leaves are put in big bags and left for a further 6 months before being packaged and sold\n\nWhite tea is made the same way as green tea but is made only from the tips of\nthe plant and thus is picked by hand and is very expensive.\n\nAfter our factory tour, we were left alone so that we could taste the tea. Dan\nand I got one cup each of their specialty teas the Palas supreme and the Palas\nAfternoon blend. They were both pretty good although the afternoon blend was\nlighter and had less tannins in it, after the disappointment of yesterday’s tea\nplantation tea I was very happy with this.\n\nWe then headed up to the mossy forest which is oldest highland rainforest in the\nworld. However first we had to sit in some traffic while two buses tried to pass\neach other on a road that two cars would only just fit on. It was interesting to\nsay the least. To get the mossy forest involved a fairly bumpy ride up some\nincredibly steep inclines and I was very glad that we were in a Landrover,\nespecially when the road disappeared completely or we had to pass someone and\nthus drive into the ditch on the side of the road. I was both impressed and\nslightly concerned for all the people who tried to do the same drive in their\nlittle protons and Hondas but we didn’t see anyone stuck so maybe it wasn’t\nas difficult as it looked.\n\nAt the mossy forest Kali really showed his knowledge of plants showing us which\nwould kill you, which were endangered, and which would make you fall in love, at\nleast according to local legend. He also informed us that most of the moss in\nthe mossy forest was actually liverwort which is more closely related to\nseaweed. He also rather astutely pointed out that people would be less inclined\nto visit the liverwort forest.\n\nAfter the mossy forest we headed back down the crazy roads but missed out on the\nopportunity to visit the strawberry farms due to the traffic of the main roads.\nAs it was a Saturday the local market was in full force and had spilled out onto\nthe roadway forcing the traffic system to be one way and thus slowing the\ntraffic dramatically. After a pretty good lunch of Indian food, which seems to\nbe most of what’s on offer, we climbed into the long-distance bus to Kuala\nLumpur.\n\nThe bus was totally uneventful although it was 30 minutes early in to KL which\nis almost unheard of in SEA. The buses as a general rule so far have been no\nearlier than 30 minutes late so we were quite surprised when this one pulled up\nat 7:00pm. After a quick but sweaty walk, we arrived at our hotel and were shown\nto yet another box-like hotel room. We dropped our stuff and went out to find\ndinner (yet more Indian food) and ended up with a Dosai bigger than my head.\nAfter dinner and a quick shower we settled in for an early night in anticipation\nof our 4:00am wake up tomorrow to catch a 7:30am flight to Borneo. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:10.555982	2018-10-17 17:55:10.555982	2018-02-25 14:00:00	52
53	\N	\nThis was a bit of a roller coaster of a morning. We had to get up at **4am**, to\nget a flight, but it took ages to get to sleep. I woke up when the alarm went\noff and checked my phone - the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours.\nI've never been happier for a delay. The next three hours of sleep weren't\ngreat, but were very welcome.\n\nWe caught a bus just after 8am, getting to the airport with plenty of time. At\nthe bag drop desk we were given meal vouchers because of the flight delay and\ncould get more in an hour for lunch. However, we soon discovered here was only\none place they could be redeemed in our terminal which may have been the worst\nfast food place I've ever eaten. The curly fries were ok and the coke float\n(for breakfast?) was too, but the bright yellow paste smeared onto my burger\nwas definitely not cheese, not even cheeseburger-worthy cheese. We decided to\nskip the free lunch.\n\nDespite being a cheap flight we had a free meal (not that I ate much) and an\nentertainment system (although I mainly programmed). The airport in Borneo,\nTawau, was pretty tiny, and we very quickly managed to find a minibus driver\nwith two spare seats to take us to Semporna, where we'll stay for two nights. <R>\nIt was all surprisingly efficient. </R>\n\nWe drove for an hour on decent roads through miles and miles of palm trees,\npresumably farmed for palm oil. We arrived in Semporna, which seems like the\nexact opposite of the natural paradise it could be. At the edge of clear ocean\ndotted with jungle-covered islands, it could be idyllic, but instead it is\nrun-down, so filled with litter and the odd open sewer that it's not too far\naway from a tip.\n\nUnfortunately, our ~~hotel~~ accommodation isn't much better. When we arrived in\nSemporna, Rosie immediately went to book snorkeling for the next day before the\nplace shut while I checked in, or at least tried to. I took off my shoes\n(standard when entering many buildings in South East Asia), then spent a good\nfew minutes wandering through the corridor saying "Hello?" before someone\neventually came out of a dorm to talk to me. Initially he told me to bring my\nstuff into the dorm, but we'd booked a private room. He took a while to check\nmy confirmation email on my phone, then knocked on the door of another room\nwhere I think another couple had recently checked in. He then had several\nconversations with them and on his phone, then moved them into the (otherwise\nempty?) dorm and gave me the room. Weird.\n\nThe room itself is another box and hasn't been cleaned in a **while**.\nPresumably for structural support, there are a few breeze blocks under the bed,\njust back enough from the edge that you can't see them but close enough to stub\na toe on, as we can both attest to.\n\nWe found a restaurant on a jetty (most of the town is on one jetty or another)\nwhere Rosie had some decent prawns. The place seems to be filled with Chinese\ntourists - some places accept WeChat Pay, which I thought was China-only\n(apparently it's not). We finished he nigh with a cupcake (we were surprised to\nfind them) and Rosie had a Corona (with kumquat in it - no limes were\navailable). <R> The fact that I put kumquat in my Corona seemed to both shock and\namuse the bar staff, apparently they had never heard of the process. It's better\nwith lime. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:11.076835	2018-10-17 17:55:11.076835	2018-02-26 20:50:00	53
54	\N	We were up at 6.45 - 7am to catch a 7.30am boat. We had a very cheap and tasty\nbreakfast of roti at a local Indian restaurant, then made our way to a dive\nshop. Originally, we'd planned to come to Semporna to scuba dive, but I've had\na cold for the last week and a blocked nose prevents you equalising pressure\nwhen you dive. Instead we decided to snorkel at a similar place.\n\nThe dive shop was heaving, full of activity. We got fins, masks and shorty\nwetsuits, then headed out to a boat with five other tourists. We were going to\nan island called Mabul about 45 minutes from Semporna. The boat journey was\nloud, but scenic. We saw just how much of the small towns in the area were built\non the water on stilts or jetties and how much rubbish there was in the sea.\nOver the course of the day, the boat had to stop and reverse three times to\nclear out plastic that had become entangled with the propellers.\n\nOnce we got to the island, we had a brief stop for the divers to get more kit,\nthen headed to the south of the island. The water was incredibly clear, so we\ncould see that the island was surrounded by a large shelf of reef, sloping down\nfrom the beach gradually until reaching four to eight metres, then falling\naway rapidly. The boat stopped quite far out, but not that deep, maybe five or\nsix metres. Most of the others with us were diving, but one woman was\nsnorkeling with us. The three of us and our guide put on our fins and jumped in.\n\nIt was fantastic. The water was fairly warm, the visibility was great (maybe\nthirty metres) and there was so much life. Fish everywhere, coral below us,\ndeep blue ocean to our left with the occasional shadowy forms of larger shoals\nor divers. There was a gentle current pulling us along the reef, so for the most\npart we just drifted along, looking at the multitude of fish and colours below\nus.\n\nWe didn't only see fish. We'd been hoping to see turtles and we weren't\ndisappointed. We saw somewhere between ten and twenty throughout the day, some\nof them massive. We even saw three together and saw another swim up for air. At\none point we also saw a sea snake, which I hadn't really been hoping for as\nthey're venom is potent enough to kill us all multiple times over. It didn't\nseem to fussed by us, though.\n\nThe day passed quickly. We had three snorkeling sessions, each about 45 minutes\nto an hour. In between, we stopped on the island, where decent food was\nprovided. Many other westerners were staying there at the resort and we talked\nto a couple of Californians. There were plenty more of the local houses on\nstilts - a surprisingly large number, given that the island is so far from the\ncoast and so small, maybe about a twenty minute walk in circumference.\n\nUnfortunately, like Semporna, there was a lot of litter. It was particularly\nnoticeable during our first swim as we spent a while trying to avoid plastic\nin the water. This decreased over the day, but seemed to be replaced by\njellyfish. They were small, about the size of a ping pong ball, and in the\nafternoon they were everywhere. Apparently they weren't dangerous, but they\ncould definitely sting. We both ended the day with the feeling of pinpricks\non the exposed parts of our bodies and gratefully accepted some vinegar to rub\ninto them. <R> I apparently react to their stings much more than Daniel and even\nnow have lots of little red dots all over my forearms and legs. I was very glad\nfor the wetsuit and mask which protected most of my body. </R>\n\nOverall, it was an amazing experience. I loved duck diving down to peer into the\ncoral, trying to capture it on the GoPro. I did end up taking quite a lot of\nvideo - I don't envy Rosie trying to edit it. <R> Thanks Daniel... </R>\n\nWe took a different boat back to the mainland with a different group of people\nas the people we'd traveled with were staying the night. Back in Semporna, we\nbooked a bus for tomorrow and got some dinner. We found a couple of new tasty\ndishes: roti kandar (roti with a curry on top with a fried egg on top of that) <R>\nnew favourite </R> , and roti tissue (roti cooked in a single layer rather than folded,\nmaking it crispy, then quickly formed into a large cone and drizzled with condensed milk).\n\nBack at our accommodation we had surprisingly decent showers, but spent a long\ntime trying to find someone to pay. We left our room several times when we heard\nvoices and eventually, after a couple of hours, found someone who claimed to\nwork there and paid them. The snorkeling was great, and it was worth coming\nhere, but I'll be glad to leave.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:11.460182	2018-10-17 17:55:11.460182	2018-02-27 09:00:00	54
55	\N	\nWe left Semporna early this morning, which I was fairly happy about, to be\nhonest. We had another decent breakfast of roti (the Indian food here is\npretty great), then hopped on the four hour bus to Sandakan. Six hours later\nwe arrived.\n\nOr at least, we were told to leave the bus. The "long distance" bus station is\n4.5km from the centre of the town. It's a weird place - apparently a new town\ncentre is being built 4.5km from the existing one beside the sea, so it's\noddly spread out. The current centre is reasonably compact, pressed between\nthe sea and steep hills, so has quite a few high-rise buildings. It's not\nquite as dirty as Semporna (although there's still quite a bit of plastic in\nthe water).\n\nOur hostel is more of our normal fare and much nicer than Semporna, too. It's\nvery central, so we had a decent lunch and spent the afternoon doing laundry\nat a laundrette (to avoid the extortionate price in our hostel - $3 per kg!).\n\nWe walked up some poorly-lit steps up a hill overlooking the centre to an\nEnglish restaurant (one of the recommended places here). I can't remember\never seeing a chicken and pineapple salad on a menu in the UK, but it was\ndecent. <R> More Guinness!! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:11.779136	2018-10-17 17:55:11.779136	2018-02-28 21:10:00	55
56	\N	The reason for coming to Sandakan was for the wildlife sanctuaries nearby.\nSpecifically, the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre and the Borneo Sun\nBear Conservation Centre. They're next door to each other, 45 minutes by\nminibus from Sandakan.\nWe got the earliest bus (9am, meaning we got to sleep in until just before\n8am!), arriving in time for the 10am orangutan feeding. The centre is situated\nin 43 square kilometres of protected rainforest and rehabilitates orphaned and\nrescued orangutans, slowly weaning them off the need for human-provided help\nand food. Visitors, like us, can see orangutans that decide to come to the\nmorning and afternoon feedings, but it's not guaranteed. The food is\ndeliberately boring to encourage them to forage for themselves.\nWe went to both the morning and afternoon feedings. We weren't lucky in the\nafternoon, probably because it was still slightly raining after an hour of\nvery heavy rain. As we saw in the informational video, orangutans don't really\nlike the rain, despite living where they do. <R> The video showed a really\nhilarious clip of a young orangutan having a massive tanrum because it was\nraining, poor little orangutan. </R>\nIn the morning, however, we were lucky. Four orangutans arrived to get some\nfood, swinging through the trees and on the ropes to the platform. They spent\n15 - 20 minutes eating and swinging, several of them grabbing food and\nswinging away along ropes, only to accidently drop their chosen bananas.\nAfter the feeding, we went to the outdoor nursery where slightly younger\napes were playing on climbing frames. There's an indoor nursery (where\ntourists aren't allowed) for younger ones, where they probably have a lot more\nhuman contact. In the outdoor nursery, they're weaned off human contact and\npaired up with an older orangutan to learn skills they would have learnt from\ntheir mother. While we were there, two slightly different sized orangutans\nspent most of the time having scrappy fights, so it looks like the buddy\nsystem is kind of like having a sibling (I'm sure all brothers fight like\nthat).\nBetween the feedings, we headed over to the sun bear centre. Sun bears are the\nsmallest bears, only growing to 1.5m (just bigger than an adult male\norangutan). Like orangutans, they're endangered, often kept as pets and take a\nlong time to rehabilitate. They also climb a lot - while we were there, one\nspent at least an hour sitting in the same tree rooting around for food. <R>\nSun bears are my new favorite bears, they are just slightly dopey but very\nadorable for it. </R>\nWhile in the sun bear centre, an orangutan made its way onto the board walk we\nwere on. There were people on all the walks leading to it, so it just sat in\nplace for a few minutes, then slowly made its way toward us. One of the\nmembers of staff got everyone near by to move back and out of the way while\nthe orangutan slowly made its way down the board walk and around the corner.\nIt kind of felt like someone was coming down the road with a police escort\nmoving the public out of the way - the orangutan almost seemed oblivious to\nus.\nOur other run in with an orangutan was back at the visitors' centre of the\nrehabilitation centre in the afternoon. It had been raining hard for a long\ntime when a slightly wet orangutan came around the corner of the next building\nand swung across the shelter between that building and ours. We moved back to\ngive it space until it left over the roof. A member of staff said he'd seen it\nearlier in a tree nearby tring to make a nest, but had probably given up and\ncome looking for better shelter.\nAfter a great day seeing fascinating creatures in their natural habitats, we\nheaded back to Sandakan. We had a reasonable dinner at a rooftop restaurant,\nthen I caught up with this diary (it's so easy to fall behind - it took me\naround an hour just to do today and yesterday).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:12.26901	2018-10-17 17:55:12.26901	2018-02-28 22:00:00	56
57	\N	It turns out there isn't much to do in Sandakan itself. We decided to get the\nbus out to Sepilok again, this time to see the Rainforest Discovery Centre.\nUnlike the previous day, the drive there was hair-raising. It would have been\nperfectly normal in Cambodia - the driver accelerated at every possible point,\nweaving around other vehicles to move into whichever lane had any space or\neven the hard shoulder. No other vehicles seem to drive like that here. <R> No\none else seemed fussed though. </R>\n\nAfter a shorter than expected time, we arrived near the Centre. We walked into\nit and found it was almost deserted. It's primary focus is education of local\npeople, then tourism, so with the orangutan and sun bear centres so close it's\nnot that surprising it was pretty empty. <R> We were more than ok with the lack\nof people. </R>\n\nWe spent most of the day making our way slowly around the grounds of the Centre,\nstopping in a couple of towers and on the canopy walk to look for wildlife. We\nheard plenty of birds and saw a few (one particularly impressive broadbill) and\na giant squirrel (the size of a cat with a huge tail). We also saw plenty of\ninvertebrates - huge butterflies, a colony of ants crossing the path, and\nseveral things that looked like woodlice, but ten times the size, with red edges\nand moved very slowly. We even saw a freshwater crab in a small stream.\n\nThe plant life was amazing. Huge trees, some with bright red fruits we couldn't\nidentify hanging from their trunks. Up on the canopy walk, we were able to\neasily see the top-most branches of the trees near us. There are also apparently\nhundreds of species of orchids, but we didn't see that many.\n\nWe walked to the orangutan centre to try and get a minibus that was supposed to\ngo at 2.30pm or 3pm, but it never showed up. We waited for the last bus of the\nday (4pm) and had the same driver as in the morning. This time, he was\nremarkably sane until the last five minutes.\n\nWe had a better dinner at the same place we went the night before (it looked\nlike the best place in town and I possibly wanted to try their salted caramel\ncheesecake). We wanted to spend the evening booking the next few steps in our\ntrip, but were too frustrated by the glacial speed of the internet in our hostel\nto book more than our next few nights.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:12.81508	2018-10-17 17:55:12.81508	2018-03-04 10:00:00	57
58	\N	We had an early breakfast at around 7am this morning in order to catch our\nflight to Kuala Lumpur. We got a Grab to the airport, <R> passing a rainbow pangolin\nstatue at the airport (there are also animal statues on all of the roundabouts\nwhich are pretty cool ). </R>\n\nUnsurprisingly, the airport was pretty small. The flight was a couple of hours\nand uneventful, and as it was internal there wasn't much faff at either end.\nWe got the bus in to KL and walked a bit over a mile to our hostel.\nAfter a quick lunch of Thai food, we went back to the hostel and had a look\nat what we could do that afternoon, quickly discovering that the wifi was\npretty much inaccessible from our room. Damn, we'd been counting on it being\ndecent so we could do onward planning.\n\nWe walked across town to a street well known for its restaurants and street\nfood for dinner. Rosie had a great chicken satay and I had bits of chicken\nand veg served in a wide ring of deep fried yam.\n\nAfter eating, we continued down the street, finding ourselves being directed\nto the sides of a street while a dragon dance was set up (presumably as part\nof Chinese new year celebrations? - it was 15 days ago...). There was a small\nstage on a corner of the street and somewhat out of the blue the announcer\nthere welcomed "Michael Jackson" to the stage. This turned out to be a thin\nasian guy in a bright red suit dancing along to Despacito, occassionally\nsinging a couple of the words. <R> I'm pretty sure that we knew more of the words\nthan he did. </R> The dragon dance prep seemed forgotten and\npeople were allowed back onto the street. It became more bizarre when\nfireworks suddenly went off on the next street over, right beside a large\nhigh-rise building, within a few metres of its windows.\n\nWe left soon after "Michael" stopped his performance and the dragon dance\nstarted as the press of people meant we couldn't really see. We headed to\nKLCC park beside the Petronas Towers where there was a water and light show\nset to music. It was essentially a large number of fountains within a small\nlake near the Petronas Towers. Each fountain had a light under it shining up\nthrough the stream of water and would change colour through the full spectrum.\nThere were hundreds of them, forming elaborate patterns and colour sequences.\nThis apparently lasts two or three hours, with music accompanying it for about\nfive minutes every half hour. It was an impressive show, but after about 45\nminutes we headed back to sleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:13.24732	2018-10-17 17:55:13.24732	2018-03-04 10:30:00	58
59	\N	The main activity for today was to go to the Batu caves just north of KL. We\nmade our way to the nearest station we could get a train from only to find\nthat there is maintenance being done on the line. We walked to another station\nand got a (packed) free shuttle bus to yet another station, then eventually\ngot a train. The first carriage was full and the next two were "ladies only",\nbut we did find some seats.\n\nThe caves themselves were impressively large, but we were somewhat put off by\nthe number of other tourists and the gift shops within the caves themselves.\nThat, and the large number of opportunistic monkeys. They were long-tailed\nmacaques, the same species that had tried to rush us on Penang Hill. Despite\nthe signs, quite a few people here were feeding them (one woman was selling\nbananas to specifically to feed to the monkeys), which is a quick way to\nencourage them to be aggressive towards people. <R> Evil little monkeys. </R>\n\nWe didn't stay that long at the caves. We got the train back into the city\ncentre, stopping at a mall to get lunch at the food court. It was lucky that\nwe did - it started to pour a few minutes after we went inside.\n\nAfter eating, we walked over to a money museum in the national bank. It was\npretty fun, with quite a few decent interactive exhibits. The best was\nprobably a brief overview of the history of finance where you had to pedal a\nbike to continue the film. There were examples of money from most countries of\nthe world and 1 million ringgit displayed as the walls of the tunnel. We\nlearnt more about the history of Malaysia and its economic development. There\nwas also a section on Islamic banking, but we both left more confused than\nwhen we entered, unsure how banking and insurance can work without interest,\nuncertainty, uneven risk, late payments or value that isn't directly derived\nfrom physical goods. <R> One google session later and I am still super\nconfused. </R>\n\nAfterwards, to get a good view of the city, we went to the Heli Lounge. It's a\nbar on an old heli pad at the top of a 34 storey building. It was packed, so\nwe didn't manage to find a seat. The views were decent, though, and the\ncocktails were prety good and not **too** expensive. <R> I mean compared to\nthe rest of KL, expensive, compared with London, really cheap. </R>\n\nWe'd heard that there was really good street food at another mall, but were\ndisappointed when we got there. Instead we went to a Chinese fusion restaurant\nwhich had some great food, especially the breaded lamb & camambert balls.\n\nBack at the hostel, we found the wifi in the common area and had a booking\nbonanza, booking the rest of our time in Malaysia, Singapore and deciding on\nwhere we are going to go for most of Indonesia (assuming we're actually able\nto book the flights we want - 12 hours later and it's still not worked...).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:13.624269	2018-10-17 17:55:13.624269	2018-03-04 11:10:00	59
60	\N	Initially, our plan for today had been to go on a tour of the botanical\ngardens. According to Lonely Planet, there were free tours at 8am and 10am.\nHowever, after not finding any other evidence of these tours on he internet,\nwe scrapped the idea of a tour and decided to go later (meaning we could lie\nin a bit). That was lucky, as we needed more time this morning to finish\nsome booking.\n\nLast night, as part of our booking bonanza, we'd decided to go from Singapore\nto Lombok, a smaller Indonesian island. It's not that popular a journey, so\nwe either needed to book it through two separate airlines or a single travel\nagency. We used Kiwi, but they required extra documentation checks to validate\nthe payment which took a long time. By this morning, it still hadn't worked\nand when we tried again we were more successful, but still had to wait on\nfinal confirmation. We spent an hour or so working on diary entries and\nphotos, but, with no confirmation in sight, gave up and decided to just get on\nwith our day. The confirmation did come through, just after another three\nhours or so.\n\nWe walked over to the botanical gardens, stopping for a delicious Indian\nmeal and at a pharmacy to replenish our DEET supplies. The gardens are huge,\nincluding a lake, a deer park and a massive bird park. We considered the bird\npark, but didn't really want to pay quite a bit of money to see birds in\ncages, even if some of them are in large net enclosures. <R> I mean it doesn't\nreally matter if you have a really big cage if you then put a really big\nbird in it now does it. </R>\n\nWe did, however, have a look around the orchid garden and got pretty close to\na monitor lizard. We also spotted a few groups of segway-riding tourist (I'm\nnot jealous, honest), then made our way down to a lake through the deer park.\nFor some reason, there were several display cages of chickens in the deer park\nalong with similar chickens roaming free. We saw a few deer, but no sign of\nthe mouse deer that are supposed to be there.\n\nDown at the lake, we saw carp, terrapins and an impressive swimming monitor\nlizard. We took some photos and used the free wifi to find some geocache\nlocations, managing to find one near the entrance to the park. On our way out\nwe successfully located it and added our initials.\n\nOn our way to another cache, we happened upon a museum of Islamic art which\nRosie had heard was good. It was very interesting, teaching us about the\nspread of Islam, Islamic architecture and weaponry from Europe, Africa and\nAsia. It also had a small exhibition on Palestine and the formation of Israel,\ndefinitely from the Palestinian perspective. On our way out we spent some time\nat a photography display from Iraq, Syria and Yemen showing before and after\npictures of buildings that had been damaged or destroyed during conflict.\nSome of the cultural and religious buildings were over a thousand years old -\nseveral were shown as they were collapsing or exploding.\n\nJust across from the museum was the national mosque, which is open to visitors\noutside of prayer times. We had a quick look inside and quite a lenghty talk\nwith one of the men volunteering or working there about the mosque and Islam.\n<R> It was really interesting to learn a bit more about Islam in a much more\nconversational way, compared with books, signs and of course, the media. </R>\nWe then condinued on to Merdeka (independence) Square, which has more\nimpressive architecture. Across the river we found some more great Indian food\nfor dinner, then headed back to the hostel.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:14.164225	2018-10-17 17:55:14.164225	2018-03-04 22:40:00	60
61	\N	Previously, we had planned at this point to go to Tioman island to go diving\nor surfing. However, with a bit more research it proved more tedious and\nunpredictable to get there than it was worth for a day or two. Instead, we\noptend to go to Taman Negara (Malay for "National Park"), the oldest\nrainforest in the world (130 million years).\n\nYou can get there either by two buses or a bus and a boat. We went for the bus\nand boat, which left from just around the corner from our hostel in KL. The\nbus dropped us off at a jetty where we could get lunch and buy permits for the\npark. The permits cost $0.25, but the fine for not having one is $2,500.\n\nThe boat ride lasted about an hour and a half in a long, thin motor boat with\nabout ten of us sat in pairs facing forward. We were sitting at water level\nand the sides of the boat didn't extend that high, so we got sprayed quite a\nbit on the way up river.\n\nThe small village, Kuala Tahan, seems to be the main base people use to\nexplore the park. It's tiny, but filled with guest houses and floating\nrestaurants (pretty low down at the moment because the water is so low). We\nspent ten or twenty minutes following different sets of instructions to get\nto our guest house - it had two names, was shown to be across the river on\nMaps.Me, and was on the other side of the village from where we were initially\npointed. Our room was nice enough - it had a balcony and a fan, but a squat\ntoilet and was pretty much an oven. <R> The fact that we spent 20 minutes\ntrying to find our guest house is really impressive when you consider that the\nentire town takes about 20 minutes to walk across. Also it was 34 degrees and\nsuper humid, we were very sweaty when we found the guest house, a theme that\ncontinued through out our time in Teman Negara. </R>\n\nThe park itself was across the river - a one ringgit ($0.25/£0.20), one minute\nboat trip away. There was a large upmarket resort on that side, apparently\nrecently renovated due to the river flooding (despite being about 10 metres\nabove the current water level). We walked through the resort to a nature hide\nnearby and spotted a wild pig before returning for dinner. The pig was\ndefinitely wild as the town is definitely Muslim, so no pork on any menu. We\nalso saw several lizards - one only a couple of centimetres long, another\nclose to a metre.\n\nHaving spent most of the day sitting, we decided to go on an organised night\nwalk in the park. At the start of the walk it looked like we'd made a mistake\n- we were with a fairly loud family and the walk was just along the 600m\nboardwalk to the hide we'd been to earlier. However, it was great - we saw and\nlearnt a lot even over that difference, and, as the family was French, I got\nto brush up on my French listening skills (or lack there of). Our guide was\ngreat and had several tricks for seeing insects. The best was that with a\ntorch on your head you can see the reflections from spiders' eyes very easily.\nThey look like little sparkles and can be harder to spot after it has rained\nas they also look like reflections from water droplets. Another trick was\nusing a UV torch to search for scorpions. They're black, but have phosphorus\nin their shell, so appear bright green in UV.\n\nWe ended up seeing loads of insects - in addition to spiders and scorpions, we\nsaw huge millipedes, worker & soldier termites, stick insects, a single\nglowworm and a single firefly. At the hide, we saw a deer and on the way back\nwe saw a porcupine under one of the buildings of the resort. On our way back\nto the guest house we saw (and heard) many large beetles, which can make an\nincredible racket <R> all night </R>.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:14.521925	2018-10-17 17:55:14.521925	2018-03-08 10:30:00	61
62	\N	The plan for the day was a long walk around a circuit in the forst with a stop\noff at a hide. We started a little later than originally planned so that we\ncould get a bit more sleep - the fan in the room, while necessary, was pretty\nloud. We had a quick breakfast and bought plenty of water and a snack lunch -\ncrisps and popcorn, the only somewhat decent looking transportable food. <R>\nDon't worry mum, we had vegtables for dinner. </R>\n\nWe got the boat across, then started along the boardwalk into the forest at\nabout 10am. It was swelteringly hot and we'd been sweating since leaving our\nguest house, <R> since before leaving the guest house if we're being honest. </R>\nThe signs said it was 9.5km to the hide we were aiming for, about\nhalf way along our circuit. We saw plenty of butterflies and heard beetles,\nfrogs, lizards and birds, but saw only one or two people an hour. We left the\nboardwalk after about half an hour, continuing beside the river deeper into\nthe forest, passing small streams and seeing our first few leeches. <R> I must\nhave seen over 100 leeches throughout the walk, and this was the dry season, I can't\neven imagine how many there must be during the wet season. Also despite being\ndisgusting, they're really funny looking creatures on the ground. </R>\n\nTwo hours into the walk, a sign said we were 5.5km from the hide. We knew we\nwere going a bit slower than normal, but 2km per hour seemed very slow. The\ndistance also didn't match up with Maps.Me, or even the other signs - it said\nit was 5km back to the village, so something was up. We continued anyway.\n\nWe passed a couple with a guide (with a huge rucksack) heading to the same\nhide, but with the intention of sleeping there. The guide seemed surprised we\nwere going for a day trip, and more so that we weren't coming back the same\nway.\n\nWe walked on, seeing huge buttress-rooted trees, insects, small streams,\nfallen trees and the leavings of some large animal (elephants?). By half past\none, we were sweaty, hungry, tired and still 2.5km from the hide by Maps.Me's\nbuest guess (our more reliable distance info source). We decided to turn\naround, find somewhere to have lunch, then head back to town.\n\nOur walk back was, unsurprisingly, pretty similar to the way out. We passed\nmost of the same people and remained very, very sweaty. We saw stunning trees,\nferns and tiny flowers. Towards the end of our walk, we happened upon a pair\nof wild pigs, just off to the side of the path.\n\nTired but happy, we finished at the resort. We treated ourselves to some more\nexpensive drinks (banana shake for me, a guinness and a 100 plus for Rosie),\nand enjoyed not walking for a while. After our rest, we headed back to the\nguest house for a much-needed shower.\n\nIn the evening, we booked onto a night safari with the same tour operator as\nthe day before, Han Travel. Along with two other couples, we got in the back\nof a 4x4 pickup truck which spent an hour driving through a palm plantation\nbeside the rainforest. A guy on the roof of the truck used a strong torch to\nsearch for animals and direct the driver. We spotted two small cat (probably\nleopard cats), a couple of owls, and, on the road back, several wild pigs. For\nme, it was worth it just to see the difference between plantation and forest.\nThe plantation had presumably been harvested or created recently - there were\nonly some small palms around, mostly just churned earth and clay. It was a\nstark difference to the lush life on the other side of the fence.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:14.938875	2018-10-17 17:55:14.938875	2018-03-08 18:00:00	62
63	\N	Still somewhat tired from the walk yesterday, we had a bit of a lie in. We used the rest of the morning by going for a few small walks along the board walks by the resort. At the start of the first one we heard a slithering in the dried leaves and saw a thin black snake make its way away from the path.\nIn the afternoon we went on a "rapid shooting" tour, which basically meant getting in one of the long, thin boats we'd arrived in and going straight through the rapids up river, getting thoroughly soaked in the process. At the first set of rapids, however, the propellor hit a rock and the engine stopped. The boat floated downstream and the driver and the guy at the front of the boat both jumped out and swam the boat closer to shore. The guy at the front held it where he could stand while the other guy fixed the problem. It started to rain, but after five minutes or so we were off and successfully navigated the rapids. <R> Daniel is down playing this. There was a really loud clunk and then the motor stoped and we started floating backwards down river at really quite an impressive speed. The guide at the front then splashed out and kicked us into a backwater while the guy at the back started pounding on the motor, presumably fixing the propellor. </R>\nBy this point, the rain was at full force. Even if we hadn't had waves occasionally soaking us, we would have been drenched in minutes. As we'd expected to get wet, it was pretty enjoyable. <R> It was great, I love it when it rains and you were already planning on getting wet. </R>\nThe boat stopped beside a small village so that the other tourists with us could go and se the Orang Asli (aboriginal people). We'd opted not to as we hadn't enjoyed similar things in the past, we know the money doesn't really go to them and that, if not for tourist money, they're traditionally nomadic. Instead, we swam in the river which was noticeably warmer than the rain. Unfortunately, that seems to have killed my watch, despite claiming to be water resistant to 100m and dealing with worse submersion before. Damn.\nBack in Kuala Tahan, we showered, dried and I caught up on this diary (a bit). After dinner, we went for our own night walk. We weren't quite as good as our guide, but saw plenty of spiders, a rat, a mouse, a frog, and several porcupines, but sadly no fireflies.\nBack at the guest house we saw our final creature of the forest - a leech attached to my neck. I have no idea how it had gotten there. Apparently 15% DEET (the highest you can buy here) wasn't a strong enough **deet**erent. <R> To be fair to the leech, and the DEET, there is a chance that Daniel missed spaying that particuar bit of skin as it was very near the neck line. How it got on to his neck though is anyones guess, they can't really climb. </R> After removing (and flushing) the leech, wecould see it was just a small cut, but it bled a lot. Leeches apply an anticoagulant to stop blood clots, so I significantly bled through my first plaster. A makeshift absorbant pad of toilet paper micropore-taped to my neck worked much better.	2018-10-17 17:55:15.294625	2018-10-17 17:55:15.294625	2018-03-08 18:40:00	63
64	\N	I've let the time run away with me again and I'm writing this six days and two\ncountries later in Indonesia ...\n\nAnyway, this was another traveling day to get back to a major hub (Kuala\nLumpur) in preparation for a flight the next day. We spent a lot of time on\na couple of buses, ending up at our hotel a few minutes from the bus to the\nairport.\n\nWe spent what was left of our afternoon washing our clothes at a laundrette\n(hot jungles apparently lead to a lot of dirty, sweaty clothes). This gave us\ntime to read and for me to catch up on a few other diary entries.\n\nThe real stand out bit of the day was the food. We (Rosie, mainly) had a\ntraditional breakfast of nasi lemak - coconut rice normally with a fried egg\nand sambal (chilli and tomato). It was pretty good, but nothing on dinner.\nRight beside our hotel in KL was a highly-rated South Indian restaurant that\nturned out to be a small chain (called MTR?) from India that had spread to\nMalaysia. The food was incredible. Rosie got a "mini meal", basically two\ntypes of bread and little dishes of maybe eight curries and a dessert (gulub\njaman?) that wasn't even part of it on the menu. <R> I love it when restaraunts\nhave tasting platter type things like this, especially when they are nice and \ncheap. </R> I had great savoury lentil\ndonuts, mangalore buns (slightly sweet, fluffy, hollow buns made from banana\nand some type of flour), and rava idli (a light, semolina-like cake more\ntraditionally made with rice). It was all fantastic and we went to sleep\nstuffed.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:15.718945	2018-10-17 17:55:15.718945	2018-03-13 16:00:00	64
65	\N	We'd stayed close to Sentral station last night so that we could get an early\nbus for our morning flight today. Both a little under the weather, we caught a\nbus around 7.30am to the airport, then got a very short flight to Singapore.\n\nWe got a bus into the centre and walked slightly outside of it to get to our\nhotel in Little India. Both fairly hungry, we headed out to find nearby cheap\nlunch.\n\nSingapore is significantly more expensive than everywhere we've been so far.\nFor example, our accommodation, which is reasonable but not fantastic, is\nabout $70 (about £50) a night. Our next accommodation, in Indonesia, will be\n$7 (£5) per night, although admittedly a bit more rough and ready. Even our\nfancier hotel in Bangkok was less at $60 (£45) and included breakfast.\n\nAll of this means we were somewhat more reserved when spending in Singapore.\nLuckily, there is plenty of pretty cheap food available at hawker food courts.\nThese used to be street vendors, but were moved into purpose-built food\ncentres by the government. They're great and have a wide range of food. The\none closest to us had, unsurprisingly, a large range of Indian food, so we\nboth ended up with types of stuffed flat bread - Rosie had a chicken naan\nwhile I had a banana prata (kind of like a stuffed, recooked crepe).\n\nIn the afternoon, we planned our few days in Singapore, then caught the\nsubway to Mount Faber. "Mount" seems like a bit of an exaggeration - it may\nbe Singapore's third highest hill, but it's only just over 100m. That amount\nof elevation was enough to give us a decent view of the sunset on one side\nand the city centre on the other. Many of the taller buildings are taller than\nthe hill - some twice as high.\n\nWe slowly made our way back towards our hotel, learning that even if Maps.Me\nshows a path in a park, that doesn't mean the path is accessible. We stopped\noff at a mall, another location for a wide range of cheap food. We got a\nmixture of Chinese and Indian foods (I'm pretty sure the orange chicken was\nbetter than Rosie's favourite Panda Express version).\n\n## Quote of the day\n**Rosie:** <R>"worms have no place in a good ratio"</R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:16.056053	2018-10-17 17:55:16.056053	2018-03-12 09:00:00	65
66	\N	More fantastic, cheap Indian food from the hawker stalls for breakfast. If you\nlived in Singapore it's probably not worth cooking - so much great choice is\navailable for so little money relative to how much people make. This morning\nwe had a dosa and a biryani (briyani here). So good, but I ended up very full.\n\nAs we were getting food it began to rain, with ominous clouds promising more\nlater in the day. Our plan was to go on a walking tour, so we definitely\nneeded some cover. Unfortunately, while packing the bag for the day our water\nhad leaked, drenching my coat. So, after breakfast, we picked up Rosie's coat\nand bought me a lovely bright blue poncho for $1 so that all of Singapore\ncould identify me more easily as a tourist. <R> He only had to wear it for like\n15 minutes... Besides I think the whole world knows that Daniel is a tourist\neven without the poncho. </R>\n\nWe took the subway (MRT here) to the centre of town to join our\npay-what-you-want walking tour called Sneak Peak Singapore. We joined a group\nof about 20 others with our guide being a young local guy of Chinese descent\nin a pink t-shirt. He'd recently finished his degree in urban planning and now\nworked for the government planning department, which definitely coloured the\ncontent of the tour. Not that I'm complaining; the planned-out nature of\nSingapore and it's development was fascinating to learn about.\n\nWe started by the river with a brief intro to the early history of Singapore\n700 years ago, then skipped to the start of British influence in the early\n19th century. Darren, our guide, explained the politics of the area at the\ntime and how the British asked for a trading port in Singapore after lending\nmilitary aid to an elder brother of the ruling family of the Johore Sultanate\nwho's younger brother had taken the throne. They'd then not charged any tax\nat the port, enabling it to outcompete the Dutch ports in the same area (the\nStraits of Melacca). <R> This was all explained with the help of a map and some\nlaminated pictures that he pulled from his magical bag. </R>\n\nWe then made our way through Chinatown, learning plenty as we went. It is\nfairly central, so is surrounded by skyscrapers, but four of its districts\nhave been preserved with the old two to five storey shophouses. They're\npretty thin as the colonial government used to tax buildings by the width of\ntheir shopfront on the main street, not by area, leading to long, thin\nbuildings up to five times longer than they were wide. <R> At this point it\nbegan to rain so we all pulled on coats and ponchos and for those that didn't\nhave a poncho with them Darren pulled about a dozen of them from his magical\nbag. It only rained for about 15 minutes though which was nice because when it\ndid rain, it rained really heavily. </R>\n\nDarren also pointed out the original shore line of Singapore, now two\nkilometres from the sea. Huge amounts of Singapore are built on reclaimed land\n- something like 25%. The earth came from hills, many of which used to be in\nChinatown. These used to give rise to a large number of wells, forming the\ncity's primary water source. Water was transported in barrels on oxcarts and\nwas so common that it affects the area's name even now. In many other cities,\nthe Chinatown is called something like "Chinese street" in Chinese, but here\nit is the three words "ox", "water" and "cart" (I forget the ordering). <R> At\nthis point it was getting rather hot so Darren pulled some fans and some frozen\nwet wipes out from his magical bag to pass around so we could cool ourselves\ndown... you're starting to see why I think this bag is magic. </R>\n\nAs we walked, Darren also pointed out some other sides of Singapore. We passed\nan electricity substation which had a sign on it warning people not to enter.\nIt didn't say it was a substation, it had a picture of a soldier aiming a\nrifle at another man with his hands up. Darren said that this was better than\nit used to be - ten years ago, the signs were all over the place and the\nwithout the gun had been lying on the ground. Apparently now they ask\nquestions before shooting ...\n\nAt several points we tried Singaporean food: at a Chinese bakery, a\nPeranakan (mixed Chinese & Malay going back 700 years) sweet cafe and at\nanother hawker court. The Peranakan sweets (kueh) were delicious - mixtures of\ngelatinous rice with various fruit flavours and creams and some pastry. I got\nto taste durian, which was pretty good, but I don't think it was strongly\nflavoured. The hawker food was also good - Hainan chicken rice (what it sounds\nlike), popiah (the best spring rolls we've had so far - a variety of veg with\na slightly sweet sauce and crunchy partly-ground peanuts), and carrot cake.\nCarrot cake is a misnomer - apparently the word for "carrot" and "white\nradish" are very similar in Chinese, but I've no idea why it's called cake.\nIt's ground radish and rice, made into balls, then fried. The "black" version,\nwhich we had, is also cooked in soy sauce. It's a slightly odd, soft texture,\nbut good. I probably won't be making it any time soon (unlike the popiahs). <R>\nWe also learned that at hawker centers in singapore, if you place a small, cheap\nitem on the table, it is considered reserved and no one else will sit there.\nCue Darren and his magical bag which held several of such items. </R>\n\nWe ended at a government housing block, where we learnt that 81% of people\nhere live in government housing. We're not exactly sure what he meant by\n"government housing", but probably government **built** housing, as it can\nbe sold after 5 years. The government owns the building after the 99 year\nlease comes to term. The housing seems pretty good - according to Darren, the\nprivate equivalent is the same standard except with a swimming pool, a balcony\nand a security guard you don't need. The government flats we saw were around\n1 million US dollars while the private ones were another 700,000.\n\nThe government flats also drew our attention to some of the interesting\napproaches of the Singapore government. They use social engineering quite a\nbit (but not in the cyber-security sense). Darren described it as trying to\ncreate the ideal society, but using pragmatic approaches rather than waiting\nfor ideal solutions. For example, some time after the subway was introduced,\npeople kept leaving chewing gum on the doors, causing them to jam, preventing\nthe train from moving and screwing up the entire system. The government\nreaction was to ban the sale and purchase of chewing gum, which remains to\nthis day. Another example is that to prevent hippy culture, in the sixties\nforeign men with long hair had to cut it before entering the country and local\nmen with long hair were served last at all government offices. Finally, a more\nserious example is that in order to buy a government flat, you need to be\nmarried or have proof that you will marry soon. The government believes that\nthe nuclear (heterosexual) family is the building block and uses this method\nto encourage that.\n\nAlso interesting was some of the personal financial policy. For an average\nsalary (very roughly S$5000/$3750/£2500 per month), the income tax rate is\nonly 3.5%. However, 20% is put into a compulsory savings account, with another\n17% added by your employer. This can only be spent on:\n  * your own (or immediate family's) healthcare\n* property\n* your children's education\n* your pension\n\nHealthcare is not free and there is no welfare state, and while there are\nprovisions for those with low incomes, it is possible to fall through the\ncracks in the system and be dependent on charity funds.\n\nAnyway, we went up to the 50th floor of one of seven government housing blocks\nwhich were linked by a roof terrace at that level. They're also linked by an\n800m running track surrounding them 24 floors below. The view was amazing,\njust on the outskirts of downtown, near many of the skyscrapers. Recent\nplanning policy has made it compulsory for all new buildings to have **at\nleast 100%** of the area of the footprint of the building as horizontal green\nspace within the building. This means many of the buildings are very green,\nwith garden levels and rooftop parks - even some with plants growing up the\nheight of the building on the outer walls.\n\nWe ended our tour and made our way to two light shows, both of which were\nfree. The first was in the Gardens by the Bay, a pretty recently developed\npublic garden space built (like everywhere else) on reclaimed land. The light\nshow is in the supertree grove (shown on Planet Earth 2). The supertrees are\nmassive pink metal structures reminiscent of branching trees with plants\ngrowing up around the struts. They are impressive and would be imposing if it\nwasn't for the nearby skyscrapers. <R> It is pretty cool but there is a lot of\nconcrete around for something that is a garden, it could do with a bit more\ngreen. </R>\n\nWe lay on the ground with the crowds in the centre of the grove and watched\nthe trees light up to a variety of Disney soundtracks culminating with Star\nWars. It was somewhat bizarre, but so is the rest of the place. We had dinner\nin the gardens' own hawker court, Satay by the Bay. Rosie enjoyed the satay\nwhile I went for another Indian bread, murtabak - a stuffed pancake, in this\ncase with mutton.\n\nWe then left the park, walking alonside the water to the hulking Marina Bay\nSands hotel - three huge, curved tower blocks supporting a slightly bent\nplatform almost like a ship above them. It also has a light show set within\nthe bay, this time made primarily from water jets. It also creates moving\npictures from lights shone through sprayed mist. At points, the jets looked\nlike lava and the music was overwhelmingly loud. The hard rock was somewhat\nover the top and didn't quite go with the gentle singing. Pretty odd. <R> It\nwas very very intense, espcially after the twinkly lights and disney music of\nthe super trees. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:16.533478	2018-10-17 17:55:16.533478	2018-03-13 17:00:00	66
67	\N	Our time in Singapore was brief - this was our second and last full day there.\nWe went for a traditional breakfast of kaya toast, which was surprisingly\ngood. Kaya is a jam made from coconut, egg and sugar and better than it\nsounds. It's spread on toast with a huge chunk of butter (maybe half the width\nand thickness of the toast), then dipped into partially-boiled eggs.\n\nWe then had our own walking tour, based off our own reseach and some\nrecommendations from Rosie's friend from St Andrews, Laura, who'd lived here\nfor a while. We started at the Buddha's tooth temple, which, unsurprisingly,\nhoused a tooth believed to have been from the Buddha (surrounded by gold).\n\nWe spent most of the rest of the day in and around the Gardens by the Bay.\nThere were loads of signs around saying what to do if you encountered an\notter, so we hoped to spot one, but failed to.  <R> Sad </R> We walked through the gardens\nin the heat and up to a large water reserve with a good view of the skyline\nand plenty of locals flying impressive kites. We then made our way to the paid\nparts of the gardens - two huge glass domes.\n\nThe first was the cloud forest, a huge structure with plants from many cloud\nforests around the world at different levels. It had a lift to the top, then\na walkway down, around and through the structure. It also, kind of\nludicrously, claims to have the world's highest indoor waterfall.\n\nIt was crowded, but impressive. Just after we arrived, lots of small hoses\nstarted letting out streams of mist all over the place. There were plenty of\nstrange plants, including the carniverous ones. The carniverous pitcher plants\nand venus fly traps were right at the top, interspersed with larger Lego\nreconstructions of the plants themselves. <R> There was\nalso a beautiful collection of many many orchids and a some what sobering\nvideo and exhibit on climate change and the effect of humanity on nature. I\nreally hope that the many locals watching the video saw and were moved by it,\nthe level of single use plastic in SEA is rediculous. I can't even count how\nmany times I've told someone I do not need a plastic bag. </R>\n\nWe then went to the flower dome - a bit smaller and currently focusing on\nmediterannean climates. There were cool baobab trees and several plants we\nrecognised from our gardens at home, especially as one of the four regions\nbeing shown was California. Unfortunately, the display was in the process of\nbeing changed, so some plants (mainly the cherry trees) were not in flower.\n\nWe went back to Satay by the Bay to verify that popiah were just as good there\nas in the other hawker court (they were). We then went to a rooftop bar called\nLevel 33 (guess what floor it's on ...) with a view of the bay and the light\nshows. The drink prices were exorbitant, but it felt like we might as well go\nfor a Singapore sling while we're here. The sneaky bar didn't include the\n10% service charge or 7% GST in their menu prices. However, the view, once we\ngot a table by the edge, was great.\n\nThe only real downpoint was losing a bit of money on the subway. There's a\nprepaid card you can buy for $5 which significantly reduces the price of\ntickets, but only lets you travel if it has over about $2.50 on it. That means\nit costs about $7.50, which is worth it for about 10 or more journeys, but not\nquite for our 5. Ah well, we'll be more skeptical in the future. <R> However\nwhen you consider the amount of money we lost on the subway tickets compared\nwith what we spent on the drinks it is really a very small amount. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:16.90896	2018-10-17 17:55:16.90896	2018-03-13 17:30:00	67
68	\N	We hadn't been looking forward to today and weren't really sure why we'd\narranged it. We wanted to be in Bali for the 16th for a festival, so had a few\ndays to kill between now and then. It would probably have made sense just to\ngo to Bali early. However, for reasons that we can't really recall, we decided\nto go to Lombok instead. Lombok is another Indonesian island, but further\n**east** of Singapore. Because of that, it's not actually that easy to go from\nSingapore to there. To do so, we ended up with two flights (through Jakarta),\nbooked through an agency (Kiwi.com). Despite the airlines being part of the\nsame group, it was a self-transfer, so we had to pick up bags in Jakarta, then\ncheck in for the next flight. <R> Yup, no idea why we did this... </R>\n\nWe had this to look forward to as we got up at 6am. The MRT to the airport\nwasn't busy and neither, really, was the airport for the size of it. The kaya\ntoast stand where I got breakfast, however, was heaving - mot helped by the\nguy two ahead of me in the queue who ordered 16 egg tarts.\n\nThe lounge at the gate was pretty comfortable and they even had a David\nAttenborough show on the wildlife of Singapore on the TVs. Unfortunately, the\nflight didn't board until the time it was supposed to take off. Had we been on\nschedule, we'd have had two hours and twenty five minutes to transfer. This\ncut that down by at least half an hour. <R> Starting to panic. </R>\n\nThe flight was fine, but didn't make up any time. Our bags were pretty late\non the conveyor belt (we've been pretty lucky normally), but immigration was\npretty quick. Then we faced the organisation of Jakarta airport.\n\nJakarta airport has three terminals. We landed in terminal 2 and needed to\nget to terminal 1. There didn't seem to be any signs, but an official\npointed us to the skytrain. This is outside the building and not as frequent\nas we would have liked - every 15 minutes in each direction, and we **just**\nmissed one. <R> Actually panicing now. </R>  Twenty five minutes later we were at terminal 1, or rather\nterminal 1B. Our tickets didn't say which part of terminal 1 we needed. We\ntried to go in, but were told to go to terminal 1C, a few minutes' trolley-run\nbehind us. <R> AHHHHHH!!! </R>\n\nAt terminal 1C, we had to through some bag-scanning security just to get in.\nWe were divided by gender here, which hasn't really happened to us at airports\nbefore. Once inside, we found the shortest queue as there was now less than an\nhour until our flight left. Several flights around hours were boarding, but\nwhen Rosie talked to the guy shouting "Lombok!" he just pointed to go back to\nour line. Eventually, someone realised we needed to get through quickly and\nso the woman at the desk processed us alongside the two guys ahead of us,\ntaking our passports, running out of the departure hall and returing with\nboarding passes (maybe her printer was out of paper? Not sure). <R> By this\npoint we were somewhere between very nervous and very fed up. It often feels\nlike no one in SEA really knows what is going on. </R>\n\nWe ran out of the departure hall, taking the escalator steps two at a time.\nThere was more security, so we were separated by gender again, then got\nthrough to an area with a few shops, but far less than outside the departure\nhall. We rushed to our gate lounge, only to sit there for at least twenty\nminutes. The time for our flight to leave came and went while the board\nstubbrnly insisted our flight was "on schedule". At least we didn't have\nanother connection. This was the only place we'd had time to consider lunch,\nbut there was only a tiny little shop. The smells earlier of the Rotiboy\nbakeries had been so enticing as we'd run past, but the chocolate bun I bought\ndidn't live up to them at all.\n\nThe flight, once we got on it, was surprisingly good. It was only 110 minutes,\nbut we got a reasonable meal and entertainment - I hadn't seen Antz in years.\n\nWe got to Lombok and realised pretty quickly we were a world away from\nSingapore, back to hundreds of people asking you if you want a taxi every time\nyou take a step. We managed, despite the internet failing, to get a Grab car\nfrom just outside the airport (probably because of taxi drivers preventing\nGrab drivers coming there - I've herad of it elsewhere). As we drove\nthrough Lombok the differences from Singapore were stark - tiny, relatively\nramshackle buildings and much poorer infrastructure. Our driver stopped to try\nand buy drinking water, which would be unnecessary in Singapore as the tap\nwater is safe to drink. There were far more scooters on the road and we passed\na substantial accident where a digger had crashed on corner.\n\nUnlike most Grab drivers, our driver was pretty chatty - at least, to me. He\ndidn't ever try and engage Rosie in conversation, only ever asking me\nquestions about her. I assumed this was due to the fact that we're now in the\nlargest Islamic country in the world, but it was still pretty weird. <R> This\ndid nothing to improve my mood. I am all for differences in culture but I did\nnot appriciate being ignored in this way. It is rude. </R>\n\n\nWe arrived at quite a nice guest house with a surprisingly big room, complete\nwith a little veranda. We headed into town (Kuta) for dinner, expecting the\nsame as in smaller tourist towns - plenty of restaurants, not much variety.\nHowever, it seems like we've done well here, to the point that we're spoilt\nfor choice. As well as the ever-present burgers and pizza, there's\ngreat-looking Mediterranean food, crepes, galletes, local food, and more. I\nhad a really good local fried rice (or nasi goreng here) while Rosie continued\nto check out the satay. <R> Guys peanut sauce is the best! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:17.312015	2018-10-17 17:55:17.312015	2018-03-13 21:10:00	68
69	\N	We got up pretty late (about 10am) this morning to try and catch up on sleep.\nIt didn't work very well as the room was pretty warm despite the fan.\nBreakfast was included in our guest house and, after ordering, it turned out\nto be served on our veranda outside our room. <R> The people who ran the guest \nhouse were lovely although the breakfast was somewhat sad. </R>\n\nAfterwards, we headed into town with the intention of going surfing, which is\nthe main thing to do here. Or rather, near to here. It became clear after\ntalking to a few surf schools that all the appropriate places were half an\nhour away by scooter. As we've never ridden a scooter, we're not overly keen\nat learning on these roads with a surfboard strapped to the side of the bike.\nWe ended up booking a lesson for tomorrow, including transport. That left us\nwith an unexpected afternoon.\n\nThere is a beach here, just without any waves. We spent the rest of the\nmorning on the beach, slowly walking along it. The sand was presumably made\nfrom coral, meaning it was really sharp in some places and quite large in\nothers, like millions of mustard seeds. When we went into the water the sand\ngave way easily so we sank into it down to our ankles. <R> We did have a \nlovely swim though, the water was nice and warm. </R>\n\nDark clouds were visible in front of us as we left the beach. We made it into\na restaurant before any serious rain started and had another delicious meal.\nI spent the rest of the afternoon catching up with this diary while Rosie\nworked on the video of Malaysia. We went to another restaurant we'd seen with\ngreat Mediterranean food which lived up to our hopes. <R> The food was all \nsurpisingly amazing in Lombok, especially for such a small tourist town. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:17.689537	2018-10-17 17:55:17.689537	2018-03-13 22:10:00	69
70	\N	We had a surfing lesson first thing this morning, so were up at 7am. We've\nboth surfed before and had lessons, but having a lesson here was the easiest\nway to get transport to a good spot along with rental. Also, neither of us\nwould claim to be any good at it, so a bit more instruction couldn't hurt.\n\nWe were picked up by three guys in a people carrier at 7.30am and spent about\nhalf an hour driving to a beach. Along the way the roads were much more\nsimilar to Cambodia and Vietnam than they were to Malaysia, never mind\nSingapore. Small corrugated iron buildings dotted the side of the road with\nstray dogs roaming freely. There were far more scooters than cars, and after\nten minutes we came upon someone who'd been thrown from their scooter after\nhitting a dog. The seemed to be fine, but shaken. The same couldn't be said\nfor either the dog or the scooter.\n\nWe pulled up to the beach and got out while the guys unfastened the surfboards\nfrom the roof of the car. We could see the waves in the distance but the place\nseemed empty - great. The waves were a reef break, meaning that they were\nbreaking far enough off shore that we were brought out by a small boat.\nDespite going out hundreds of metres, it didn't get much deeper. The water was\nso clear that we could see the bottom and even some fish.\n\nWhen we got out to the break there was no one else there. We each had an\ninstructor and there was one extra guy. We took our foam boards off the boat\nand paddled out. The waves were only breaking in one particular area, meaning\nit was easy enough to avoid the break and paddle around them to the left and\nright. We positioned ourselves as our instructors told us and both managed to\nstand up on our first wave, admittedly with a push from the guys behind us. <R>\nWhoooo!!!! </R>\n\nWe were in the water for about two hours. More people arrived over that time,\nso when we left there were 10-15 of us in the water. The waves were perfect\nfor our level. We caught most of the ones we attempted (often with a helping\npush), and were able to ride some of them for quite a long time. A lot of\nwhat I'd learnt years ago came back, so I managed to turn left and surf along\nthe wave (then turn right to avoid crashing into a stand up paddle boarder\ncoming the other way).\n\nThe one problem with catching a wave for a long time is that we needed to\npaddle **a lot** to get back to the break. So, by the end of the two hours we\nwere both pretty tired, but managed to get back into the boat to get back to\nshore. Overall, it was a great morning - I'd been looking forward to surfing\nagain for a long time and this lived up to my expectations. <R> Guys, Daniel is\nunderselling how tiring it was to paddle back out. I was exhasuted by the end. </R>\n\nBak in Kuta, we had a decent, if small, lunch. I wasn't feeling that great\n(or at least my digestive system wasn't), so didn't want much. Unfortunately\nthis kind of ruled our afternoon as once we got back to our guest house I\nneeded to be within easy access of a toilet for most of the afternoon. We made\nthe most of our confinement, however, and played plenty of games - charades,\n20 questions, etc.\n\nBy dinner time I was feeling a bit better so we headed into town for dinner.\nWe ended up at a place that specialised in galletes, which were fantastic. We\nfinished with a nutella crepe, which was as good as expected. Back in our room\nit turned out I wasn't quite as recovered as I'd hoped. <R> Spoiler alert,\nhe lived. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:18.263582	2018-10-17 17:55:18.263582	2018-03-18 10:30:00	70
71	\N	We had a mid-morning flight to Bali, so had breakfast then got a shuttle from\nour guest house to the airport. I was feeling a bit better than yesterday,\nwhich was lucky given that we were spending quite a bit of it traveling. I\nhadn't slept well, so both of us ended up asleep on the brief flight.\n\nWe got a taxi to Ubud to stay with my mum's friend Denise for a few days.\nUnfortunately, she was currently in Jakarta at a meeting, but we were greeted\nby her housekeeper and given a fantastic lunch. <R> Thanks Denise and Jeru! </R>\n\nDenise's house was amazing, just outside of the centre of Ubud, big and open\n(and thankfully cool). We were staying in a smaller building just on the other\nside of the pool from the main house. We caught glimpses of her four cats\n(some more shy than others and one that seemed particularly afraid of me) and\nmet her two dogs, Lily and Ski. <R> The dogs were very cute. </R>\n\nWe spent the afternoon wandering down into Ubud, having a look at temples and\nbuying a couple of things at the market. We followed a small walk through the\nrice paddies out of the town, surprisingly close to the centre. As we walked\nwe came across a lone, limping chick, cheeping for its mother without success.\nWe heard what we thought were chickens 100m up the path, so (after a brief\nchase) caught it and brought it to the enclosure. It turned out they were\nactually ducks ... so we went the other way down the path until hearing a\ncockerel, beside which was a chicken with similar-sized chicks. <R> Good dead\ndone for the day. </R>\n\nWe went back to the house for a little while o drop off stuff, then headed\nback into town for dinner. Ubud has a very wide selection of restaurants, so\nwe went for a decent-looking tapas place and ended up with some fantastic\nfood. I topped off the evening with a little bit of raw chocolate from a\nchocolate shop / factory up the road. <R> He said he was only going in to \\"look\\". </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:18.500261	2018-10-17 17:55:18.500261	2018-03-18 10:50:00	71
72	\N	Having not slept particularly well the night before and having a really good\nbed last night, we had a bit of a lie in this morning. When we got up and made\nour way to the kitchen we were gretted by Denise who'd got a late flight the\nnight before from Jakarta. We chatted over breakfast and for some of the\nmorning, then went down into Ubud.\n\nWe had a great lunch at a primarily vegetarian restaurant, then followed a\nridge walk on the other side of town for the early afternoon. By the time we\nmade it back to the centre, people were starting to gather for the night's\nfestivities. <R> The walk was beautiful, with lovely views of a jungle and of\nsome rice paddies. </R>\n\nTomorrow is Nyepi, Balinese Hindu New Year. As part of that, on the day before\nNyepi (today), people in Balinese towns parade giant, demonic effigies called\nogoh-ogoh through their towns in the evening to drive out all of the evil\nspirits. Tomorrow, the entire island of four million people will shut down,\nwith no travel and very little noise or light, so that the evil spirits pass\nover the island. <R> It is very impressive that they can shut down an entire\nisland including the airport. They also shut off the internet. </R>\n\nWe had a snack dinner at a restaurant recommended by Denise very close by to\nthe area the ogoh-ogoh were going to gather at. After eating, we joined the\ncrowds lining the streets as they began to arrive. They're all sorts of\nshapes and sizes, primarily twisted, partly-human figures, but not always.\nThey're made from foam and cloth, presumably with a wire or bamboo frame,\nsometimes with coloured electic lights set into them or their frame to shine\nonto them. They're supported on large lattices of bamboo poles, creating\nsquares up to 8x8 or 9x9 with groups of men, women or children carrying them,\none person per bamboo cell and the effigy taking up the centre. All in all,\nit's reminiscent of a St Patrick's Day parade (which is tomorrow), but held at\nnight and somehow combined with Halloween. <R> And also louder and more chaotic. </R>\n\nOnce they had all arrived in a large, open field, we (along with thousands of\nothers) moved between them, looking at them more closely and taking photos.\nMany had their own strangely-coloured light sources and one even had an\nin-built smoke machine.\n\nAfter a while, a torch-lit procession began to lead them all back up the\nstreet to the centre of town. The larger ogoh-ogoh were so tall that they\nwould have become entangled in the overhead electrical wires, so had to have\nmen with long bamboo poles to lift the wires out of the way while the\nprocession passed. This just added to the general mayhem of the day - around\nfifty people shouting as they carried the ogoh-ogoh, with others shouting to\nstop them before they entangled with the wires, then to go when the wires were\nlifted, with thousands of people on the street and bands of drummers and\ncymbalists(?) adding to the general racket. <R> It was somewhere between hilarious\nand very impressive, particuarly as the larger ogoh-ogoh looked very heavy and\nthe men carrying them looked exhasuted by the end of the night. However some\nof the smaller ogoh-ogoh were carried by children who appeared to be having\nthe time of their lives. </R>\n\nThe crossroads at the centre was heaving, but we managed to get a place on the\nstreet with an ok view (gradually getting better as we made our way to the\nfront). It turned out the ogoh-ogoh were from four or five different groups\nwho then took it in turns to put on a show in the street, with music and\ndancers, followed by the ogoh-ogoh. Large groups of people would carry the\nogoh-ogoh, moving them up and down, spinning around and running up the street\nas the tightly-packed crowd quickly backed up (I only fell over once in the\nthrong). The aim seemed partly to be to shake the effigies so hard that they\nbroke - the crowd shouted the loudest when one of the wolf-men broke in half\nand when one of the hag-like female ogoh-ogoh lost her head.\n\nThe original processions started around 6pm, but these performances didn't end\nuntil well after 11pm. It was a pretty hectic evening and by the time we were\nback at Denise's we were ready for the relaxed day ahead.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:19.026701	2018-10-17 17:55:19.026701	2018-03-18 11:20:00	72
73	\N	As well as being St Patrick's Day at home, today happens to be Nyepi, Balinese\nHindu New Year (and therefore our third new year this year). It is a day of\nmeditation with four primary rules:\n* No travel\n* No work\n* No fire\n* No entertainment\n\nIn practice, this means you're not allowed to leave your house and you're not\nsupposed to turn on the lights or make much noise. Denise told us that things\nhave been getting stricter over the years - originally, kids would maybe play\nquietly in the street, but now there are essentially religious police checking\nyou don't leave. <R> But of course in order to check that you're not breaking\nthe rules and going outside, they have to break the rules and go outside... </R>\nThe government has turned off the TV for the last few years\nand this year was the first year they disabled the internet. The entire island\nbasically shuts down - there's no noise apart from the animals (mainly\ninsects, dogs and roosters).\n\nWe'd had a late night, so it seemed like a good day for a lie in. We had a\nlate breakfast and started a new book each - I started American Gods as I've\nbeen meaning to try some Neil Gaiman for a while. We spent most of the morning\nreading and some of the afternoon in Denise's pool. <R> I started Sapiens,\nwhich is really really interesting, I would definetly recomend it to anyone\nwho likes to think. </R>\n\nWe had a great lunch of roasted veg and pizza with Denise, slightly breaking\nthe rules (this seems to be ok, as from what I've read, in hotels they allow\ntourists to have light and cooked meals, but put up curtains so that it's not\ndisturbing others). We chatted for the late afternoon until the sun went down,\nprompting a quick go at the washing up and gathering of torches (less\nobtrusive than turning on the house lights).\n\nOnce the sun was fully down we were rewarded with a great view of the stars.\nIt was pretty clear, partially due to Nyepi effectively leading to an almost\npollution-free day. We saw plenty of stars, some shooting stars, some\nsatellites, a few lightning flashes and a reasonable number of fireflies. We\nonly saw one plane as the airport had also been shut.\n\nWe used a little bit of light to go to bed and had a relatively early night.\nIt was good to have a day like this on our trip and I'm glad we were able to\nspend it at Denise's and with Denise - it might not have been quite so\npleasant cooped up in one or two of the box rooms we've ended up in so far.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:19.22608	2018-10-17 17:55:19.22608	2018-03-20 21:00:00	73
74	\N	The day after Nyepi seems to be business as usual. Our plan for the day was to\nhead to another Indonesian island - Flores. Denise was also leaving later in\nthe day for a two week trip to Africa.\n\nOur flight was in the early afternoon, so I spent the morning catching up on\nthe diary (but clearly not well enough, given that I'm writing this three days\nlater). Denise arranged a taxi for us to Denpasar airport. The journey took\na surprising amount of time because of all the traffic, but sped up once we\nreached a large toll road built over the water. There are quite a few bridges\nover other roads, making it feel like spaghetti junction, just above the sea.\n\nThe airport wasn't busy, so we breezed through check in and security. For the\nsecond time this trip I found a key that I should have returned in my pocket\nat security ...\n\nThe food in the domestic lounge was pretty decent. I had a reasonable fried\nduck and rice while Rosie had gado gado - an Indonesian dish of vegetables,\npeanut sauce, and, at least in this instance, rice crackers. Also, to my\ndelight, there was a Beard Papa stall, so we were able to have some more of\ntheir delicious cream puffs. <R> Gado gado, or at least good gado gado, is\namazing. I mean I know I have bit of a thing for peanut sauce but its just so\ngood. </R>\n\nOur gate was changed and neither of us fully heard the announcement, but\nluckily decided to check it out. There was no longer a line at the gate, but\nstill time before the flight left. Cream puffs in hand, we made it onto the\nplane.\n\nIn less than an hour, we touched down in Labuan Bajo, Flores. We were picked\nup by a taxi from our hotel, which actually isn't that far away. The hotel\nis pretty nice with a decent large room and a helpful owner who gave us lots\nof advice. <R> He also paid for the taxi, as he had said he would come and pick\nus up but his father had taken the car. This was very nice of him and was a real\nindication of how lovely he was throughout our stay. </R>\n\nLabuan Bajo is pretty small and seems to exist as a gateway to Komodo National\nPark. We walked down into the centre from our hotel to arrange our next couple\nof days, checking out four or five of the tour agencies. They mostly run the\nsame tours, but we were able to find close to what we wanted. We also had to\npay for them and our four nights in the hotel today, so had a lot of cash on\nus. It looks like even more in Indonesian rupiah, given that $1 is just under\nRp 14,000 and £1 is just under Rp 20,000. They don't seem to make notes less\nthan Rp 2,000.\n\nWe came back to the hotel to phone home as we have internet today and it's\nthe weekend, making it easier to deal with the time difference. We went back\nto town to find dinner, an OK Italian meal, before heading to bed in\npreparation for an **early** start.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:19.367253	2018-10-17 17:55:19.367253	2018-03-20 21:20:00	74
75	\N	Today had an **early** start - 4.30am. Thankfully, our hotel provided us with\nbreakfast and was happy to do so at 4.50am (prearranged), so we had a\nsurprisingly tasty omelette and fruit.\n\nWe had a full-day tour booked, starting at 5.30am in town, a 20 minute walk\naway. We arrived and waited a while, then were taken to the harbour to wait\nin our boat for more people. A little annoyed that we could have slept for\nlonger, we waited for around half an hour for our long, thin boat to fill up\nwith eventually ten other people. We had seats on one side of a thin table at\nthe front, meaning people had to squeeze past us or the Japanese couple across\nfrom us to walk the length of the boat.\n\nDawn came and went very quickly, then the boat chugged out of the packed\nharbour into the sea. We dozed as the (slow) boat spent maybe a couple of\nhours getting to Padar island, our first stop. This is a particularly\npicturesque island, full of sharp limestone peaks and surrounded by clear\nblue water and sheltered coves. We walked along a path up a hill (with plenty\nof other tourists) and enjoyed the view over the island and the others near\nby. <R> The views were lovely and the tourists started to peter out as we got\nfurther up the mountain. </R>\n\nAn hour or so later, our next stop was the island of Komodo to pay our park\nfees and see Komodo dragons, the largest lizards in the world. We went on a\nshort walk to a man-made watering hole (currently turned off), where there\nwere three adult male Komodos lying in wait for prey that comes to drink.\nApparently it's a common hunting technique for them - appear asleep, then\nsprint at 20km an hour to kill deer or pigs (we saw both not too far away).\nThey are impressive creatures, more than two metres long. I did feel sorry for\nthe park rangers, however, spending day after day telling tourists not to get\nto close in case they get seriously injured ... <R> Mind you they do pretend\nto be asleep and then sprint to catch their prey so I would also be very\ncautious with anyone in my care. </R.\n\nWe then took our boat to a beach near by with almost pink sand. The boat\nanchored maybe 50m out and we donned snorkeling gear before jumping into the\nwater. Unfortunately, my mask fogged up within a minute no matter what I did\nto clean it, so I spent a lot of time with salt water in my eyes and a foggy\nmask. However, we did manage to see quite a few fish as we swam and dived.\n\nWe were the last back to the boat which had already started moving when we got\nthere. For some reason, we were told to swim to the back to hand up our fins,\nthen swim/haul ourselves to the front of the boat while it was moving to get\nup the steps. Not particularly comfortable or necessary, as a crew member just\nbrought our fins to the front of the boat when we got out.\n\nOur last stop was at manta point, where, you guessed it, we managed to see\nmanta rays. At least one anyway. The boat slowed out to sea as the water\nbecame shallower and clear, maybe 15m deep. A member of the crew came up to\nthe front, staring down into the water. After a few minutes, he pointed to the\nfront right, shouting "There! Jump!". I caught a glimpse of a huge black ray\nseeming to flap its way through the water before rushing to get my snorkeling\ngear.\n\nWe spent maybe half an hour with lots of people in the water swimming after a\nmanta until it was lost, then holding onto the side of the boat while people\non our boat and the other few near by searched for another manta, only to\nrepeat the process. I didn't get a better look than that first glimpse,\npossibly because my mask was still fogging up. The look I got was great,\nthough. <R> I got a pretty good view and they are just amazingly magnificant\ncreatures, the way they swim is just beautiful. </R>\n\nOn the way home I warmed up and dried off on the roof of the boat, which, in\nretrospect probably wasn't my best decision of the trip. I'd made it this far\nwithout getting properly sunburnt shoulders - ah well. <R> To be fair Daniel\nhas managed 3 months in SEA without getting properly sunburnt, which given his\npropensity to get sunburnt is pretty impresive. </R>\n\nWe had some reasonable sushi for dinner, along with gnocchi that was better\nthan the food from the Italian place the night before. We decided on how and\nwhere we wanted to go on the Gili islands, our next place, and booked most of\nthat.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:19.648731	2018-10-17 17:55:19.648731	2018-03-21 17:20:00	75
76	\N	We had another tour booked for today, but starting at the more civilised time\nof 8.30am. When we arrived we were greeted with a lime iced tea at their\nrestaurant and told that no one else had booked today, so we had the boat to\nourselves.\n\nLike the day before, we walked down to the harbour, but this time got a small\nboat out to where our boat was moored (rather than wedged into the press of\nboats at the jetty). Today's trip was double yesterday's in cost (excluding the\npark fees, which were large), and it showed on the boat. It was the same type,\nbut well painted and more comfortable - a larger table, longer benches and\nbean bags towards the back. Like yesterday, there was tea, coffee and water\nprovided. In addition, there was a big bunch of ripe green bananas. We didn't\nmake much of a dent in them despite my attempts - there's only so many bananas\none person can eat and for some reason Rosie didn't want any. <R> Nope. </R>\n\nWe had three separate destinations, all for snorkeling and all to the north\nrather than the east, so not in the national park. Our first was around a\njetty off an island, where we saw plenty of fish of many different kinds. I\nhad a bit of difficulty with my mask fogging, but not as bad as yesterday.\nAfter a while it began to get cold, so we headed back to the boat. Right at\nthe jetty we spotted a black moray eel poking out from a crack in the rock\nwhich (hopefully) we got some half-decent footage of (I was goProing at the\ntime). <R> We also saw a huge numner of fish and some great blue starfish, I \nalso a ray but Daniel sadly missed it. </R>\n\nOur next stop was a tiny little island with a shelf of rock and sandy beach\nwith one other boat already there. We snorkeled part way around the island,\nspending most of our time at the wall where the reef descended sharply into\ndeeper water. As we were getting in the water Rosie spotted a small shark and\nshot off to film it. <R> It promptly shot off away from me, maybe it is camera\nshy... </R> After some time swimming around and duck diving down to\nget closer to the coral, we began to get cold again and headed towards the\nboat. The water began to heat up a bit, so we spent a bit more time closer to\nshore, then went back to the boat. <R> The area we were swimming around in has\nvery strong currents and lots of wierd streams so while one bit of ocean would \nbe freezing the area just next to it would be nice and warm. </R>\n\nWe were served a delicious chicken and coconut milk curry with rice for lunch\nwith little biscuits to follow. We had a bit of a lie down on the bean bags\nafterwards as two of the three crew members had a bit of a snooze.\n\nOur last stop was just off another island, this one just large enough to host\na small hut and apparently some chickens given the frequent cock-a-doodle-doos\nwe heard. There was a line of buoys out to prevent boats going into a\nparticular area which we discovered hosted plenty of wire frames with coral\nattached, presumably as an attempt to regrow some of the reef. One of the\ncrew members had said that the reef at our first spot used to be better, but\nhadn't had the protection of being in the national park. The coral on the\nframes did seem more vibrant, at least in colour, than elsewhere and was\ncovered with fish. I really enjoyed diving down beside the wall and looking\nunder the frames to see the large fish there and the tiny ones among the\ncoral.\n\nAs we finished snorkeling, a party boat (maybe a liveaboard for divers?)\npulled up near by, blaring music. We slowly made our way away from them and\nback to Labuan Bajo. Back at port, we said goodbye, showered back at the\nhotel, and went back into town. Rosie was craving some tacos (taco Tuesday -\nI'm impressed I know what day it is), so we went to the town's taqueria.\nDespite quite a tasty papaya salsa, it didn't quite live up to expectations.\n\nI finished off the day with a bit of diary writing, but didn't quite get up to\ndate.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:19.924736	2018-10-17 17:55:19.924736	2018-03-21 18:00:00	76
77	\N	\nAfter a few expensive days, we planned to spend less today. When we had\narrived, our host at the hotel had offered to take us to a couple of local\nsites free of charge, so we asked to do that today.\n\nThe first stop was at a large limestone cave which, if you're lucky (we\nweren't) you can see the refracted light from the sun. We had a guide and a\ntrainee show us around, pointing out massive stalagmites and stalagtites. They\ntook us into a natural room further within the cave complex where the roof was\nancient coral complete with a fossilized turtle. \n\nOn our way to the other attraction of the day in the battered old SUV we got\nchatting to our host, originally from Lombok. He'd come to Flores in 2005 and\nworked as a tour salesman, but by the sounds of things had become addicted to\nonline gambling. He then conned tourists out of money to fund it, then went on\nthe run across Indonesia. He ended up in prison for a couple of years and said\nafter living on the street it was significantly preferrable. He'd now seen the\nerror of his ways and gave free tours to tourists (like the one we were on) as\na way of repenting. The hotel we were staying in belongs to his father, who'd\ngiven him a job after he was released, but had refused to help him when he was\ndown, saying he had to clean up his own mess. He now values that harsh\nfairness from his father. <R> He was a very interesting person to talk to and \nwas by all accounts lovely but I'm very glad we met this side of him rather \nthan the other side. We also got to talking about politics, both of the US \n(everyone has an opinion on US politics) and of Indonesian politics, which was \ngood to learn a bit more about. </R>\n\nHe also pointed out a huge new hotel being built, with about 500 rooms each at\ntwice the next most expensive places to stay in Labuan Bajo (which happen to\nbe fancy boat hotels that only have about six rooms). He thinks that there\njust isn't the demand, so may just be a way of cleaning money. That being\nsaid, apparently it's fully booked for September, so there's a lot of pressure\non the workers to finish on time.\n\nOur other stop was an impressive viewpoint from the top of a steep hill down\nonto curved sandy bays with sunlit green and blue sea. There were only a few\nother people around (and the obligatory drone).\n\nBack in Labuan Bajo, we went to the restaurant of the people we'd booked our\nsnorkeling with the day before. We had some pretty good food, including the\nfirst burger we'd ordered so far on the trip (apart from the free burger at\nMarry Brown fast food chain in KL, which may not have been enough of a burger\nto count ...). We wrote a load of postcards, then posted them, only to find\nout that here you get a free postcard with every stamp, so now we have a load\nmore. <R> We also found out that the stamps are MASSIVE and so if you've \nreceived a postcard with a really big stamp and a sentence that doesn't make \nsense try peeling back the stamp. </R>\n\nWe shopped for some souvenirs with some success, wrote a few more diary\nentries, and had some more decent sushi for dinner. I finally actually added\nthe new entries to the site for the first time in a week before packing for\nour early flight, then went to sleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:20.31724	2018-10-17 17:55:20.31724	2018-03-22 22:00:00	77
78	\N	We got an early breakfast (like the previous two days, banana pancakes that\nalmost definitely contain coconut milk - poor Rosie), then a five minute lift\nto the airport. To our surprise, the guy from our hotel had insisted on being\nthere around an hour and a half before the flight. It's a tiny airport, but we\ntrusted his judgement. That meant we wound up outside the airport at 6am (for\nour 7.20am flight) with a small group of other passengers waiting for the\nairport to open... <R> Grumble. </R>\n\nMaybe twenty minutes later, we got in, quickly checked in and got through\nsecurity along with the seven or eight other people there. We read until being\nallowed on the plane, where we both fell asleep pretty quickly. At some point\nI woke up with some plane food in fornt of me, so had a little and read for\nthe rest of the flight.\n\nFrom the airport we managed to get a Grab, despite internet reports that this\nwasn't possible from Denpasar airport. I don't think the driver was thrilled\nto take us as far as we wanted to go, but we did need to get there.\n\nWe ended up in Padang Bai, a port that seems to mainly exist to transport\npeople to the Gili islands (our next stop). We arrived at about 11am, before\nour hotel was ready for us. It turned out we could probably have gotten to the\nGilis directly today, but couldn't be sure beforehand. <R> The interent was not\nparticularly forthcoming with information which was a bit annoying really. </R> \n\nWe had an ok lunch and spent the afternoon on the beach, reading on some\nsunloungers. The warung (small restaurant / foodstand) owning the sunloungers\nseemed to suffer from a problem common to most of the places similar to it\nacross all the countries we've been - it had an extensive menu, but a large\nproportion wasn't actually available. In this case it was most of the drinks,\nso no banana shake here. Ah well, dinner was a lot better, with really good\ntoasted cheese sandwiches and a creamy purple rice pudding. <R> The beach was \ndown a small path from the main road which was well signposted from the road \nas being 300m away. After following the path for about 200m we came upon another \nsign, this one upside down also stating that the beach was 300m away, and then \nanother 200m along was a third sign saying it was 300m to the beach. Not one of\nthose signs was correct. </R> \n	2018-10-17 17:55:20.607057	2018-10-17 17:55:20.607057	2018-03-22 22:30:00	78
79	\N	Our hotel provided a pretty big and decent breakfast this morning. Rosie\nwasn't forced to eat banana pancakes, which is probably a plus. We had a boat\nto catch, but at 11am, so didn't need to get off too early.\n\nWe packed up and walked down to the port town, really feeling the heat with\nrucksacks on our backs and fronts. At the boat we were told to go to the\noffice to get the ticket for our booking. At the office, we were told to go to\nanother office, who gave us one set of tickets then brought us to the first\noffice to exchange the tickets for another set of tickets, then sent us back\nto the boat. According to the sign on the second office, it was a "one stop\nshop" ... <R> Sigh </R>\n\nThe boat took about 90 minutes to get to the first of the Gili islands, our\ndestination. There we waited for people to get on and off before heading to\nGili Meno, the smaller, quieter island that we're staying on. The boat was\nreasonable and was showing the remake of The Karate Kid quietly, but\nsubtitled, on mulltiple screens. However, the film was paused at the first\nisland and never resumed. It happened to pause right at the start of the final\nfight of the film, a really frustrating place to leave it. Ah well.\n\nWe got onto a small barge with our luggage, then took off our shoes to wade\ninto shore. Despite being located in the centre of the island, our hotel was\nless than ten minutes' walk away - the island is only about 2km by 1km. There\nare no motor vehicles, just a few bicycles and horses and carts.\n\nOur hotel was great - A/C, fan, (possibly working) safe, fridge, lots of free\ndrinking water, private bathroom and patio, free tea and coffee and a\ndelicious dragonfruit shake welcome drink. We dropped of our stuff and headed\nback to the beach we'd arrived at for a small lunch and to organise some\ndiving for tomorrow.\n\nJust after we'd suncreamed up ready to go snorkeling it started to rain. We\nwalked back in the direction of our room and the rain petered out. We\ncontinued on o the other side of the island, but the wind had picked up,\nmaking the sea too rough for snorkeling to be worth it. The waves also weren't\nbig enough for surfing, so we lay on the beach reading for a bit before having\na brief dip, finding out just how shallow the water was.\n\nAfter showering, we got back to the beach in time for a spectacular sunset\nwhere the sun fell behind Gunung Agung, Bali's tallest volcano (the one which\ncaused quite a bit of disruption a few months ago). We slowly walked north\nalong the beach and found somewhere reasonable for dinner (a better pizza than\nlunch).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:20.891929	2018-10-17 17:55:20.891929	2018-03-23 22:40:00	79
80	\N	It turns out that despite seeming great, it wasn't the best for uninterrupted\nsleep. It's right beside the island's mosque, so the pre-sunrise adhan being\ncalled through the minarets woke us both up. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, so\nwas able to get back to sleep pretty easily, but unfortunately the same is not\ntrue for Rosie. We'd only booked two nights here, so I spent a while this\nmorning looking for somewhere quieter to spend our last two nights.\n\nWhile I was booking that, Rosie did a scuba dive refresher course with one of\nthe dive centres on the island. I joined her at 11am to go on a dive along\nwith a divemaster from England (who'd studied in Edinburgh). <R> She was\nparticularly lovely and made me feel very comfortable, so that was great. </R>\n\nThe dive was great fun - I love the feeling of being weightless, suspended in\nthe water. We were taken out on one of the shallow-bottomed local boats with\nlarge bamboo poles supported far out to either side to provide stability\nwithout a keel, which made it a little more difficult to maneuver after\nrolling backwards off the boat.\n\nWe saw loads on the coral reef - many species of fish, big and small:\nclownfish, scorpionfish, boxfish, pufferfish, Indian walkman. We saw a huge\ncuttlefish and two species of turtles - green sea turtles and a hawksbill\nturtle. <R> Our dive master was particularly good at finding things for us to\nsee and mimed them to us with a particularly entertaining series of signs, for\nexample the signal for clownfish is putting your thumb on your nose and \nwiggling your fingers. </R>\n\nAfter coming up we decided to do another dive, so had a pretty quick lunch.\nWe realised that diving quite a bit here is going to be pretty expensive, but\ndecided that we won't get the opportunity particularly often, so should just\ngo for it.\n\nOur other dive was also fantastic. It was in a similar place, but also\nincluded a wrecked jetty that sank maybe ten years ago after falling into\ndisrepair. Among other things, we saw a lionfish, a tiny bright yellow spotty\nboxfish, two giant frogfish, one painted frogfish and a large shoal of small\norange fish hidden between two large rocks. <R> The tiny fish are my favourite,\nespecially the tiny clown fish that we saw. </R>\n\nAfter a dip in their pool, we booked another three dives with the dive centre\n(Blue Marlin), then went back to shower. We had dinner near where we had\ndived, with another sunset behind the volcano, but not as spectacular as last\nnight.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:21.141541	2018-10-17 17:55:21.141541	2018-03-24 21:10:00	80
81	\N	We didn't have any early morning commitments today, so we could have a bit of\na lie in. After a tasty pineapple-heavy breakfast, we packed up (programmed a\nlittle), then changed hotel to somewhere nearer the sea and further from the\nloud adhan. The new place is nice, not quite as nice as the previous place,\nbut does have a mosquito net and rents snorkeling gear.\n\nWe rented snorkels, masks and fins and went snorkeling beside the harbour near\nby. We saw quite a few fish, but the reef wasn't as vibrant elsewhere. We did\nalso see what was probably a smallish sea snake.\n\nWe showered and walked up to the north of the island for some reasonable (and\ncheap) lunch, then picked up the snorkeling gear again and walked around the\nsouthern half of the island clockwise to go snorkeling again. Here there were\nquite a few boats out and several groups of other snorkelers, probably because\nof the underwater sculptures. There was a ring of life size human statues a\nfew metres down just off the coast and quite a few people around it with\nGoPros taking picures, so of course we joined in. One group consisted mainly\nof people in lifejackets, which they would occasionally remove, with guides\npositioning them and taking videos of the statues for them. It was slightly\nbizarre to have the standard tourist throng with everyone trying to take the\nsame picture - something we've experienced **a lot** over the last three\nmonths - only this time underwater. <R> It was a bit bizarre. </R>\n\nOn the way back in we happened to encounter a turtle (I think it was a\nhawksbill turtle) really close beside us. It swam in one direction, then\nturned around towards us and swam back the way it had came to our right to go\nup and get air. Rosie managed to get some decent shots on the GoPro of it.\n\nWe walked back to our hotel overland (we couldn't go past the salt lake\nbecause it had flooded the path) to shower so we could head to another place\nin the north of the island for dinner. The restaurant was called Little Bali\nand was filled with Balinese art. I had a Nasi Campur, which is rice with\nsmall amounts of local dishes, so I got interesting veg chooped finely (almost\nlike a pico de gallo) covered in fish sauce, tofu, tempe (kind of like a\nsoybean cake), grilled chicken and a brilliant beef rendang. I also had fried\nbanana for pudding, which was excellent.\n\nWe played three rounds of pool at the pool table in the restaurant after the\nmeal, all won or lost due to my luck rather than skill. I won one game\nprimarily due to potting balls in ways that I had not intended. I lost the\nother two by accidentally poting the black prematurely ...\n	2018-10-17 17:55:21.386947	2018-10-17 17:55:21.386947	2018-03-25 22:50:00	81
82	\N	Today was our last full day in South East Asia - it's gone really quickly.\nIt's possibly been one of our more expensive days too as we decided to splurge\na bit on our last day.\n\nWe had booked to do three dives today with the same dive centre as before (you\nget a discount for doing five). We also decided to bring the GoPro along, so\nunlike two days ago there should be some evidence that we went, too. I had the\ncamera for the first and last dive while Rosie had it for the middle one.\n\nOur first dive was just after 9am at "Shark Point". We did see a couple of\nwhite-tipped reef sharks swimming about in a small cave, but not any more than\nthat. We did see plenty of turtles, however. There was quite a strong current\nfor the entire dive, which made maneuvering more difficult even though we\nmainly just let ourselves drift with it. It was also a bit disorienting that\ntowards the end we ended up in a current going almost the opposite direction.\n\nWe had the same guide for all three dives who I think had only recently\nqualified as a divemaster or was just about to finish qualifying. She was ok,\nbut had a habit of aking us a bit too deep - we went to a bit below 20 metres\non every dive, despite the fact that, strictly speaking, we're only qualified\nto 18 metres. 20 metres is probably ok, but on our last dive she went to 27\nand we probably went to 24 ... We're fine, though, so no real problems, and we\nhave a good thirty hours until we're flying. <R> I was more disgrunteled by the\nfact that she wasn't as good as the other guides at picking out fun animals to\nshow us. </R>\n\nThe other two dives, before and after lunch, were good fun - slightly less\ncurrent and along walls of coral. We saw some tiny nudibranch and damselfish\nas well as really big turtles, a stingray, a peacock mantis shrimp,\nscorpionfish, quite a few types of eels, lionfish, remora cleaning turtles ...\nI think I got a few good shots of Moorish Idols, which we've seen everywhere\nbut I really like (Gill from Finding Nemo).\n\nSince arriving on Gili Meno we'd planned to have our last dinner at a\nreasonably fancy and slighly more expensive place on the western side of the\nisland we'd walked past on the first day. Unfortunately, the sunset wasn't\nquite as good as that first evening and it was a little windy, but we got a\nwell-lit, comfortable table on the beach at the edge of the water. We had a\nfantastic meal which rounded out our time in South East Asia pretty well -\nspring rolls, a chickpea curry and naan for me and chicken satay with fried\nrice for Rosie. All have been common foods during parts of our trip and they\nwere all done well. We had some decent drinks and an interesting baked nutella\ncheesecake. We spent the meal coming up with our best and worst points in\nvarious categories - food so far, accomodation, animals, activities ...\n\nAll in all, a good end to a great (half of a) trip.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:21.726844	2018-10-17 17:55:21.726844	2018-03-26 22:10:00	82
83	\N	I've let these get out of hand again - I'm writing six days later ...\n\nWe left Gili Meno, Indonesia and South East Asia today. We didn't have to be\nat the harbour until 11am, so we had a leisurely breakfast and packed\nafterwards. We waited at the harbour for about 45 minutes while talking to a\nCalifornian couple who were traveling after finishing teaching English in\n(South) Korea for a year.\n\nThe ferry was loud, bumpy and not direct - we stopped at Gili Air & Lombok\nbefore turning around to head to Bali. It was ok, but not quite as nice as the\nway to Gili Meno (and neither of us saw any dolphins this time). When we\narrived at Padang Bai port we were ushered onto a minibus (while, as usual,\nmany people tried to sell us taxi rides). Before getting on we used probably\none of the dirtiest toilets we've seen so far and paid for the privelege. <R> \nIt was really very gross. </R>\n\nThe minivan to the airport was pretty uncomfortable and only had four\npassengers including us. We spent most of the hour and a half journey coming\nup with possible three course meals we could make (both somewhat missing\ncooking). Near the airport the driver told us we had to pay the airport\nentrance fee, which we had also been asked for when leaving the airport in a\nGrab. In both cases it probably should have been included in the fare, but it\nwas a small amount of money ...\n\nWe were very early for our flight - it left at 10pm and we arrived at about\n4pm. <R> While this may seem like overkill there was a very real possibility \nthat the boat would be over 2 hours late and that the taxi would take twice as \nlong so we decided to play it safe rather than sorry. </R> \nPretty hungry by this point, we went on a hunt for food with a\nfully-laden airport trolley. Of course, wandering outside an airport with\nluggage meant that we were constantly bombarded with calls of "Taxi?" and\n"Where are you going? I give you good price". When we replied "Sydney,\nAustralia", some stopped, but many just replied without listening, just saying\n"Yes, cheap price". Like other places, saying no to a taxi driver meant that\nthe one behind him would ask us the same question, despite clearly seeing us\nsay no to the first ... <R> I got quite angry at one point, but then I had a \nsandwhich and calmed down. </R>\n\nAnyway, I managed to get a warm rotiboy coffee bun, but there wasn't a great\nselection of food. We ended up at a cafe outside the check in & departures\narea and stayed there for quite a while. When check in opened, we made our\nway through (with the somewhat standard visa faff along the way). Our gate was\n6A, so we sat down at gate 6 and waited, listening to the many gate changes\n("due to an aircraft parking change, flight X has been moved to gate Y") which\nseemed to occur for most flights. We didn't realise that gate 6A was located\n**underneath** gate 6, not beside it like all the other gates ... It's been a\nprobably at least 10 years since my name was called over an airport tannoy\nsystem (the last time was in Bristol, I think, where missing the flight would\nhave been less problematic).\n\nWe made it onto the flight to Sydney. Rosie immediately tried to get to sleep\n(probably sensible - it was a six-hour overnight flight), but I watched the\nsecond Kingsman movie on my phone (free Wifi so that Virgin Australia didn't\nhave to install screens in their seats).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:22.140413	2018-10-17 17:55:22.140413	2018-04-01 11:30:00	83
84	\N	After half a night of patchy sleep, we woke up before landing in Sydney -\nthree hours ahead, a new country and continent for me and also the furthest\nsouth I've been so far.\n\nAustralia's customs process is notoriously strict, so we decided to declare a\nsmall wooded souvenir we had purchased. It turns out this was a good idea -\nthe customs official was very friendly, let us keep the souvenir, gave us tips\nabout Sydney and let us on our way. There was no line, so it was all very\nquick. The other people around us had opted for the "Nothing to declare"\nqueue, which was significantly longer as people were being randomly\nsearched. <R> He was lovely but I have to say I don't remember a single thing\nhe said as no sleep does not improve my memory, I was quite pleased with\ngetting through the line twice as fast as everyone else though. </R>\n\nProbably our first mistake here was withdrawing money. We've been in cash\neconomies for the last three months, so it felt wrong not to have at least a\nlittle cash. Four days later and we have paid for everything by contactless\nunless we remember we have A$100 in cash we need to spend ... <R> I did tell\nDaniel this but did he listen... no. </R>\n\nOur flight had arrived at 7am and we got through the airport quicker than\nexpected. The airport isn't too far from the city, so we arrived at our Airbnb\ntoo early to get in. We took the opportunity to get some breakfast, then had a\nbrief one hour nap once we could get into our private room in the shared\nhouse.\n\nThe main reason we had for coming to Sydney was to see Marianne, a friend from\nSallies who's just started a PhD here. After our nap, we met Marianne at a\ncafe close by for some great food (Rosie's been missing bread in particular)\nand caught up. <R> Guys, bread is just delicious, especially good bread, I mean\nwe're not talking sliced white bread here, this was good bread. </R>\nAfter eating, we decided to see the city centre sights, so took\nthe train to Circular Quay. There, we took in the sites of the Harbour Bridge,\nthe Opera House and the massive cruise ship moored between them. We walked\naround, finishing at the Opera House where we said goodbye to Marianne and\nwent into the botanical gardens.\n\nWe spent a while in the botanics, walking around the succulent garden and\nusing the free garden wifi. I had a carrot cake at the cafe and we sat on the\ngrass outside for a while as Rosie wasn't feeling that great. We saw several\nparrot-like birds while we were there and plenty of ibis and, on our way out,\ngot a good view of a kookaburra. <R> It didn't do the fun call thing though. </R>\n\nWe walked back to the Harbour Bridge and, with a bit of searching, found our\nway up to walk across it. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be that many\ndecent-looking places to eat there, so we got the train back to Redfern,\nseeing the sunset from the Harbour Bridge.\n\nIt turned out that not that many places were open and those that were open\nwere just as expensive as where we had been. I guess we were a little too used\nto cheap South East Asian prices. We ended up at a slightly upmarket\nFrench-inspired place with a set two-course meal. Rosie got a starter and I\ngot a dessert (creme brulee) and for once we got the same main (gorgonzola\ngnocchi - we've been missing cheese) due to he reduced meal selection. It was\ngreat and came with a glass of wine of which surprisingly few of the options\nwere Australian.\n\nWhen we left it was actually a little cold, which was somewhat novel. We also\ngot shouted at by a guy on the street and realised that since leaving the UK\nwe haven't really seen any public drunkenness until now. We stopped at an\nunnecessarily air-conditioned Spar to get some bread, butter and bananas for\nbreakfasts. I also got a Dairy Milk - unsurprisingly, not as good as the UK\nversion, never mind Irish, but a chunk is still good when shaved into a toasted\nbanana sandwich.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:22.333327	2018-10-17 17:55:22.333327	2018-04-02 15:50:00	84
85	\N	Despite a lie in until 9.30am, we were both a bit groggy, probably due to Bali\nbeing three hours behind Sydney. We had our toast (or toasted banana and Dairy\nMilk sandwich), then caught a bus to Coogee, a beach in the south of Sydney.\nWe met Marianne and spent the early afternoon walking up the coast past\nvarious beaches and coves, ending at Bondi beach. We stopped part way through\nfor milkshakes and iced tea, or rather, tea with ice because they didn't do\niced tea ... <R> It was hot outside and I wanted iced tea which they didn't make but\nthey happily brought me a pot of tea and a cup of ice. Everyone was cool with\nit, but Daniel and Marianne made fun of me for the next 3 days. It was just\niced tea. </R>\n\nComing from the UK, Australia seems very similar, but with just a few\ndifferences that occasionally catch me out. It's almost like the US, but\nwithout quite as many differences. As we walked past all the little beaches it\nwas very reminiscent of Southern California, especially with all the free\nwater fountains in the parks.\n\nAnother similarity was the food. We'd looked up Australian food and found that\na lot of "Australian" food seems to be from other places, maybe with a new\nname (sausages are "snags", a mille feuille is a "vanilla slice", spag bol is\nthe same and all are quintessentially Australian apparently). We had classic\nAustralian beach food - fish and chips, complete with mushy peas. The chippy\neven sold deep fried Mars Bars and haggis. <R> They are also trying to claim\nthe sausage roll which is just not on. </R>\n\nVery full of greasy food, we got the bus further north to Watson's Bay, right\nat the sourthern mouth of the harbour. We had a brief sceneic walk above the\ncliffs before checking the ferry schedule, only to find we'd missed the last\nferry. We got another bus to the next ferry stop that still had ferries\nrunning to catch one to the centre.\n\nLike London's Oyster card system, you can get prepaid Opal cards here to pay\nfor trains, buses and ferries. Unfortunately, unlike London (as far as I\nknow), contactless cards can only be used directly on ferries and have higher\nfares. Anyway, we used our Opal cards quite a bit, so between daily fare caps\nand weekly discounts we ended up with quite a few cheap journeys (but did\nspend quite a lot overall).\n\nThe ferry from Rose Bay to Circle Quay was great - we got a decent view of the\nHarbour Bridge and probably the best view of the trip of the Opera House. The\nferry was large, comfortable and had free wifi. It was slightly delayed as it\nhad to maneuvre around the huge cruise ship that was leaving, but we had time.\n\nWe parted ways with Marianne at Circle Quay and searched out one of Sydney's\nchocolate cafes after her recommendation. We found a Lindt cafe geared up for\nEaster, complete with Lindor pick and mix of quite a few weird flavours. I had\na Lindt chocolate lava cake with white chocolate ice cream, but held back from\nindulging too much. Next time.\n\nWe went back to Circle Quay for sunset and saw the light show projected onto\npart of the Opera House at about 7.30pm. Up close, the Opera House is not as big as I\nexpected - a bit smaller than I thought and it's actually hard to get a\npicture that looks like the well known, iconic Sydeny pictures, just because\nthat close up you can only get a couple of sections of the building in the\npicture.\n\nHaving had a rich chocolate dessert earlier, I wasn't that hungry, but Rosie\nwas. We found an almost-empty restaurant and cocktail bar and shared a\ncharcuterie board and a couple of drinks. We got the train back to Redfern\nafterwards and walked back to our Airbnb.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:22.684426	2018-10-17 17:55:22.684426	2018-04-02 16:20:00	85
116	\N	Today was a lazy day. Rosie wasn't feeling that great and neither of us were\nparticularly enamoured with the few sites nearby that seemed to be open at the\nweekend. We took the opportunity to have a bit of a rest day - finally getting\nthis diary up to date. We also revisted an old classic, downloading a GameBoy\nemulater to my phone to play a Pokemon game we both knew. Great day.\n\n(If you're reading this, happy birthday Katie!)\n	2018-10-17 17:55:37.995394	2018-10-17 17:55:37.995394	2018-04-29 23:40:00	116
86	\N	We had another lie in today and were better rested for it. We got the train to\nCircular Quay, stocked up on suncream, then got a packed ferry to Manly in the\nnorth.\n\nOnce there, we stopped for a slightly dissapointing lunch - a Vietnamese pork\nroll (not as good as the banh mi we'd had in Vietnam) and a stodgy chicken and\nwhite sauce pie (not great despite the fact that Australia likes its pies). Ah\nwell. <R> Oh ya, australia also tries to claim the pie, guys you can't have\nthe pie, everyone likes pies. </R>\n\nWe walked across from the harbour to the coast to see Manly beach - a\nsignificantly larger beach than all of the ones we'd walked past yesterday. We\nrented a foam-topped surfboard and changed into swimming gear, then headed to\nthe beach. Rosie took our stuff and I swam out to the edge of crowds of\nsurfers.\n\nThe surfing was fun, if not quite as successful as our time in Lombok. My best\nwave was probably my first and I spent a lot of time duck diving under waves.\nI came in briefly for a rest, but Rosie wasn't that keen on having a go, so I\nwent back out to make the most of the two hours with the board.  <R> There were\ntoo many people for my liking and the waves didn't really look that good. </R>\n\nThe currents were strong and odd, with side currents from different directions and\nmultiple dips in the sea floor level causing strange areas of weak waves but hard to\njudge current. I actually found it quite difficult to swim in the second time\nuntil I caught a wave (my second best) and got close to shore.\n\nAfter returning the board and leaving our valuables in a locker, we both went\ninto the water in one of the few crowded swiming areas. Because of the\ncurrents the allowed swimming areas were tiny, with barely twenty metres\nbetween the flags. It was hard to do any sort of bodyboarding as the waves\nwould just smash us into several other people packed into the water.\n\nWe showered and changed before catching the ferry back. We decided to just walk\nback to the Airbnb rather than get the train as it was only 4km. As it was\nGood Friday, many shops and restaurants were shut, but we found a decent place\nserving gyros (and also Chilean food today, getting us in the mood for South\nAmerica).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:23.024758	2018-10-17 17:55:23.024758	2018-04-02 16:40:00	86
87	\N	We had an earlier morning, up at 7.15am, to catch a train out of the city to\nthe Blue Mountains for the day. The Blue mountains are two hours (and, due to\ndiscounts, about £1.50/$2) from Sydney and apparently sometimes look blue due\nto the eucalyptus forests that cover the area.\n\nWe met Marianne at Central Staion along with Tara and Callum, friends from St\nAndrews we'd met up with earlier in Thailand who're now working in Sydney. The\ntrain journey passed quickly and with a smattering of familiar place names\nreused in Australia (eg Penrith). We got off in Katoomba, a bit higher and\ncolder than Sydney and unfortunately covered in clouds.\n\nMarianne knew a great gingerbread cafe in a converted church, which, once we\narrived, hadn't actully opened. This gave us a chance to buy some lunch at the\nAldi up the road (no Lidl in evidence), enabling us to get a bit of goats'\ncheese while we could. Back at the gingerbread cafe, I loaded up on chocolate\nwith a hazelnut hot chocolate and a salted caramel chocolate cake that pretty\nmuch set me up for the rest of the day.\n\nWe walked through the town to a viewpoint where the clouds were just clearing\nenough to make out the outlines of some impressive cliff faces near by. We\nwalked down a pretty packed path to three huge rock pillars called the three\nsisters. As we did so, the cloud lifted a little, giving us stunning views\nacross the forest hundreds of metres below. The path was thin, the tourists\nwere plentiful and the drops were pretty sharp, but the handrails were good.\n\nBack up at the viewpoint we got a much better look at the landscape which was\nbreathtaking. We took another path and very quickly got away from the bustle\nof the viewpoint, but with multiple points with possibly better views. It\nbecame crowded again near a waterfall and the skytrain station (a pretty big\none-carriage horizontal cable car over a gorge), but the views were worth it.\nThey could maybe do with a couple of ziplines, but so could Sydney to be\nhonest.\n\nWe had our packed lunch at a picnic bench in a small park. It was lucky that\nthe day hadn't warmed up that much, meaning our goats' cheese was still good\nfor dipping our crackers into. Afterwards, we made our way back into town to\nthe train, arriving just in time.\n\nBack in Sydney, we found an open bar/restaurant close to where we were staying\nand Tara and Callum live. Slightly more places were open today than yesterday,\nbut a lot were closed - it feels kind of like Ireland. We all got pizza and\nsebago and sweet potato chips without really knowing what sebago was - turns\nout it's a popular variety of potato here (which made great chips / roasties).\n\nBack at our Airbnb, I phoned home, which is a little more awkward here due to\nthe time difference. We're here during one of the few weeks a year that it's\nten hours between the UK and Sydney - due to the two daylight savings' times,\nlast week it was a difference of eleven hours, tomorrow it will be a\ndifference of nine hours. That also means that this year I miss the "spring\nforward" clock change and instead get two "fall back" mornings. I wish it was\nlike that every time ...\n	2018-10-17 17:55:23.352796	2018-10-17 17:55:23.352796	2018-04-02 17:10:00	87
88	\N	This was our last full day in Sydney, April Fool's day (not that we noticed),\nand Easter Sunday. Knowing that we have a lot of traveling tomorrow, and\ntherefore probably crappy sleep, we had a decent lie in. Once we got up, I\nwrote a little bit of the diary (which I've been neglecting). We then had a\nbit of a booking bonanza for Argentina, spurred by the fact that we may need\nproof of onward travel to enter. Not sure if I'm looking forward to those bus\njourneys - the seven hour one during the day across the Andes should be\nspectacular, but the fifteen hour one through the night may not be.\n\nSydney was still pretty quiet because of Easter, but we found a streetfood\narea called Spice Alley where we were able to get reasonable versions of\nSouth East Asian food for quite a bit more than we had been paying for over\nthe last few months. Still worth it for the roti, though.\n\nWe met up with Tara and Callum again to play ping pong at a public table in a\npark near their house (they have their own bats and balls). The wind made an\ninteresting fifth player. We then walked down to Darling harbour to meet\nMarianne, then meandered past the conference centre and restaurants, over a\nbridge and sat and chatted by the water. We spent the early evening in an\ninteresting 1920s style bar called Palmer & Co which was pretty busy by the\ntime we left.\n\nLike the previous few days, it took a little while to find somewhere that was\nopen for dinner. During our search, Marianne stopped at a supermarket to buy\nus a packet of Timtams, insisting that we couldn't leave Australia without\ndoing a Timtam slam. Timtams are biscuits similar to Penguins - two chocolate\nbiscuit slabs with chocolate cream inbetween, all coated in chocolate. A\nTimtam slam is where you bite off the opposite corners of the Timtam, then use\nit as a straw to drink some tea. The Timtam pretty much melts, so becomes\nmessy very quickly, but, having now done it a few times, it is great. They're\nquite a bit better than Penguins because the chocolate tastes a lot better,\neven before it melts. <R> I mean it was ok I guess. </R>\n\nAnyway, after a bit of a wander, we found a tasty burger place which,\npresumably, because of the holiday, was out of bread - only low-carb or gluten\nfree versions available. Rosie and I ordered sliders which did come with\nhigh-carb, gluten-rich bread, so they must have run out of larger buns.\n\nWe said our goodbyes to Marianne at the nearest train station, then walked\nback towards Redfern, saying goodbye to Tara and Callum near our Airbnb. We\npacked up our bags ready for an earlier morning for our flight tomorrow.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:23.667603	2018-10-17 17:55:23.667603	2018-04-02 17:40:00	88
89	\N	This was a long, **long** day. About 38 hours I think, maybe 28 awake.\nBecause we crossed the international date line, the timeline of today was a\nbit odd - our last flight left at 8pm and arrived at 4pm on the same day ...\n\nWe were up just after 7am to get our first flight, and to have our last\nAustralian culinary experience - a Timtam slam. We got an Uber to the airport\nand Rosie got a tea with the last of our Australian cash.\n\nOur first flight was a decent three hours to New Zealand. We were flying with\nAir Newzealand which had a great selection of films (unsurprisingly including\nall of the Lord of the Rings films). Even the meal was pretty good (for a\nflight).\n\nWe had five hours in Auckland - standard airport, so we read a bit, added a\nfew days to the diary and did a little programming. Our flight to Buenos Aires\nwas a further twelve hours, so a lot more waiting around, but this time with\nfilms to pass the time. Because we were arriving in the afternoon I thought\nit would be best not to sleep (most of the rest of the people on the plane\ndidn't seem to have the same opinion). I ended up watching four or five films,\nby far the best being the Fugitive, and a few episodes of Rick and Morty.\n\nPretty groggy, we landed and got an Uber to our hotel. It had one of those\nlifts with wire mesh walls up the inside of the staircase and stopped abruptly\nat the third floor. As far as we could tell, there were no other guests at\nthe five-room hotel. Our room was pretty different to other places we've\nstayed - a single bed with a steep ladder/staircase leading to a double bed\nabove the door, hanging partially over the edge of the platform that supported\nit.\n\nOur first priority was to try and get some local currency, which proved\nsurprisingly difficult. We tried four ATMs and all of them were out of money.\nIt turns out that in addition to last Thursday and Friday being public\nholidays for Easter, today was also a public holiday, meaning no one will have\nrefilled the ATMs. <R> That being said everytime we have seen an ATM in\nargentina since there has been a massive queue of people outside it so maybe\nits just really hard to get cash out here. </R>\n\nAfter failing to get any money, we just decided to find somewhere to eat that\naccepted card. We found an Italian restaurant that was close to deserted at\n8pm - apparently, people don't eat here until 9 or 10pm. That's a pretty big\nchange from South East Asia, and definitely from the Gili islands, where\nplaces would be packed around sunset. I had a fantastic mozzarella-stuffed\ngnocchi with a creamy tomato sauce that I wish I could replicate.\n\nWe collapsed into bed, exhausted. <R> I mean its not every day you cross the\ninternational date line... every other day maybe. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:24.007463	2018-10-17 17:55:24.007463	2018-04-06 23:50:00	89
90	\N	We were given a decent breakfast by the hotel, including dulce de leche as a\nspread to put on our toast. Buenos Aires seems to be crazy for this stuff -\nit's in about half of their desserts.\n\nWe spent the morning looking up what to do in Buenos Aires, settling on a\nwalking tour for today. Beforehand, we had some routine tasks to complete -\nfind an ATM with money in it, get laundry done, etc. Leaving to do these\nthings, I wasn't able to find my hat anywhere, so must have lost it somewhere\nlast night. I've had it for a few years, it's got a decent brim and is\nwaterproof, so would be hard to replace ... <R> He was very very upset about\nthe loss of his hat, apparently it has sentimental value. </R>\n\nWe had a long walk to a cheap street food street, where we got a couple of\nclassic meat sandwiches (one bacon or "bondiola", one sausage or "choripan")\nwhich we could then top up with veg from a variety of bowls. We had a look\naround an old ship, now a museum, that had been used on voyages to the\nAntartic but now sits in one of the harbours. <R> I had a lot of fun playing\nwith the photo translate function of the google translate app. My spanish is\nok but they never taught me what a iron wrench was in spanish class. Plus the\napp is cool. </R>\n\nWe then went on a walking tour which was great. It was focused on the cultural side of Buenos\nAires rather than the political and historical side. That being said, it\nstarted at a statue of San Martin, the liberator of Argentina (and close to\nhalf of the rest of South America). Our guide pointed out that people from\nBuenos Aires (porteños) are prone to exaggeration, of which the statue is an\nexample. The horse has two legs off the ground, which should apparently mean\nthat the person died in battle, but San Martin did not.\n\nNext to the park with this statue were two very different monuments to\nArgentina's relationship with the UK. The first is "pequeño Big Ben", a clock\ntower given as a gift from the UK to Argentina in honour of the centenary of\nits independence (it's very different in style from Big Ben). Nearby and\nfacing it is the Malvinas (Falkland Island) War memorial. It had fresh flowers\nand apparently normally has two guards, but possibly they had the day off.\nYesterday was a public holiday commemorating the war, which seems to be fresh\nin everyone's minds - they're taught in school that the Malvinas are part of\nArgentina (along with a fair hunk of Antartica) and Malvinas veterans get\nreduced fares on public transport. <R> I'm not sure at what point argentinian\nadults learn that the Malvinas are not argentinian, our guide spoke as thought\nit was common knowledge but if they learn it in school, at what point are they\nnotified of the truth. </R>\n\nOur guide (and quite a few people we've met since) talked quite a lot about\nthe "golden age" of Argentina, roughly from the 1880s to the 1930s or 1940s.\nDuring this time, Argentina exported a lot of beef (their main export now is\nsoya to feed other people's beef catle herds) and encouraged immigration from\nEurope. A small number of families owned a lot of the land and became very\nwealthy. They toured Europe frequently and that influence can be seen in the\nmany French-style palacios dotted about the city. We saw eight on the tour and\nin total there are close to 40 left standing of the original 108. Most of the\nmaterials for the buildings came from Europe along with their architects.\n\nBuenos Aires definitely seems wealthy compared to South East Asia, but also\nquite focused on how good things used to be. Admittedly, given some of their\nhigh import taxes and high inflation rate (apparently 50% two years ago and\n25% last year), I can kind of see why. It feels pretty European, or maybe\nAmerican due to the grid system of the roads. Almost all the streets are one\nway or very, very wide, but many people have told us to beware of the crazy\ndrivers. We haven't seen any evidence of this to speak of - definitely not\ncompared to South East Asia. People pay attention to traffic lights here, if\nnot stop signs, and one way does mean one way, not just one way for cars, two\nways for motorbikes.\n\nWe had a bit of a wait after the tour until dinner because restaurants don't\nopen until 7.30pm - 8.30pm here. We wandered around a park at the end of the\ntour in the upmarket Recoleta district. We've been trying to follow a basic\nexercise regime for the last few weeks and so did so today in an outdoor gym.\n\nOur guide had recommended a place nearby for empanadas (small pasties that are\nextremely popular here), so we shared four, all with different fillings. I had\nanother local delicacy for dessert: an alfajor, basically two crumbly biscuits\njoined by a layer of dulce de leche. Rosie had a "lemon pie cake", which\nturned out to be almost cake-like pastry, a layer of lemon and at least five\ncentimetres of meringue - apparently that's how they like it here. <R> Daniel\nate most of the meringue. </R>\n\nPretty tired by this point, we made our way back, buying a bottle of red wine\nand some Dairy Milk on the way (unfortunately not as good as home ...).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:24.58904	2018-10-17 17:55:24.58904	2018-04-07 19:20:00	90
91	\N	The jet lag really hit us today. We probably went to sleep at about 11pm last\nnight, but woke up at 12.20pm today. <R> Whoops! </R> Our hotel breakfast ended at 11.30am and\nour plan had been to go on another walking tour at 11.30am, so we'd managed to\nmess up both of those plans. Luckily, the hotel staff gave us some breakfast\nanyway, which was really good of them.\n\nOne of the main things that seems to be recommended to do in Buenos Aires is\nto walk around a cemetery in the Recoleta, despite how morbid that seems. We\ntried to get the bus there, which is really cheap, but after 25 minutes at a\ncrawl, we got out and walked. Of course, after two minutes, the traffic\ndissipated and the bus zoomed past us.\n\nThe cemetery feels like a town itself, with gridlike streets lined with\nmausoleums. Like the palacios yesterday, most date to about a century ago\nduring the "golden age". Some are works of art, with statues, engraved rock\nand stained glass windows meant to be viewed from inside the mausoleums.\n\nThe most celebrated tomb there is somewhat understated. Evita, or Eva Peron,\nis still massively famous here despite dying in 1952. Part of that presumably\nis because of the disappearance of her corpse during one of Argentina's\nmilitary regimes. The military overthrew her husband's government and outlawed\nPeronism, making it a crime even to speak his or her name. After more than a\ndecade, it turned out that the military government had buried her in Italy.\nHer body was returned to her husband, then in Spain with his third wife, who\napparently displayed the body in his dining room near the table. Due to a\npopular protest (involving stealing another corpse), her body was eventually\nreturned to Argentina, where it is now buried. <R> As bizzare and complicated\nas this story sounds there is actually more to it including a doctor who was\nat one point in charge of looking after the body of Evita untill it was discovered\nthat he was in love with Evita, and acting accordingly. </R>\n\nWe had a decent lunch (with some great cakes), then went to look at the Pink\nHouse, effectively Argentina's White House, except in the city. Unfortunately,\nthere was a lot of construction work going on in he square in front of it,\nplus there's a massive fence in front of it, so we didn't get that great a\nview.\n\nWe spent the evening booking the next stage of our trip from our hotel. We\nwent to a highly-recommended empanada place and had four empanadas and some\nfalafel tacos (I think they **could** be great, they just weren't here).\n\nWe finished off the night at a milonga - an Argentinian tango night. We\narrived as a tango lesson was finishing, then watched people dance and\nlistened to a band perform. Rosie had some red wine while I tried Fernet, a\nlocal herbal liquor kind of like Jaegermeister, but with a less pleasant\nflavour (I wouldn't recommended it). The tango performers who finished the\nnight were fantastic, using the entire stage, rarely opening their eyes\nand executing some impressive spins. <R> Daniel wouldn't dance with me :( </R>\n\n<R> P.S. For some reason I took mainly video today thus the lack of photos,\nsorry. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:24.982136	2018-10-17 17:55:24.982136	2018-04-10 23:30:00	91
92	\N	After another night of not great sleep (thank you, jet lag), we woke up still\npretty tired. Our plan had been to take the train north to the river delta at\nTigre, which is supposed to be picturesque. However, while it was cheap to get\nthere, it didn't look like it would be as cheap to do some kayaking as we had\nhoped. We'd probably just end up sitting on a boat and going to ok museums, so\nwe decided to just stay in BA centre.\n\nWe took the opportunity to go on the walking tour we'd missed yesterday, and\nI'm glad we managed to go on it. We had a different guide, but the three other\ntourists who'd been on our other tour happened to be there too, along with a\nDanish couple and an English/French guy.\n\nThe tour focused more on the politics and history of Buenos Aires, starting at\nthe congress building, which is very similar to the US Capitol Building. Our\nguide told us a bit more about the structure of Buenos Aires and how it is\nbased around the avenue Rivadavia beside congress. This avenue runs east to\nwest through the entire city. Many north to south roads cross it and change\nnames as they do so. On these north to south streets, addresses are given by\nthe number of metres to Rivadavia and each block is 100 metres, making it\npretty easy to work out how far you are from other places. In addition, the\nsquare outside congress contains a large white stone with "0km" on it which is\nthe exact location used throughout Argentina to calculate distances to Buenos\nAires. <R> The whole city feels like it was drawn on graph paper by someone\nwith a very long ruler. </R>\n\nAs we walked on, our guide pointed out some of the older buildings, built\nduring the golden era of Buenos Aires when it saw itself as "the Paris of\nSouth America". One of the most interesting was heavily influenced by Dante's\ndivine comedy and had been the largest building in South America at 100m when\nit was built, one metre for each canto of the Divine Comedy. Apparently it had\nbeen built by two Italian immigrants who, during WWI, were afraid that Europe\nwould no longer be a safe resting place for Dante's ashes and wanted to build\n a sanctuary for them. The ashes was never moved, but the building has many\n designs inspired by the book, eg the basement and ground floor represent Hell\n with nine archways and monstrous statues. The middle floors represent\n Purgatory while the top few floors represent Heaven, with a lighthouse and\n balconies reminiscent of clouds.\n\nTowards the end of our tour we headed back to the Pink House and saw several\nprotests for various things - according to our guide, they have an average of\ntwenty a week. Later in the day we saw the most common demonstration - a march\nin rememberance of the 30,000 people who disappeared during the last military\ndictatorship in the 1970s and the women who stood up to it. As part of this,\nquite a few of the people who disappeared were pregnant women, so around 400\nchildren are believed to have been born to mothers held by the regime, then\nhidden with new names in other families. There has been a long running\ncampaign to try and reunite the now-grown children with their biological\nfamilies and our guide said that the 127th missing child had been reunited\nonly two months ago.\n\nAs we got closer to the Pink House, the English/French guy in our group kind\nof slumped and said he was fainting. We gave him some water (that vanilla coke\nbottle has served us well) and others gave him some coke and he perked up. He\njust hadn't had enough to drink, which is understandable as it wasn't hot\nenough that you'd immediately think to do so.\n\nOur tour ended by the obelisk erected in 1936 to commemorate 400 years since\nthe founding of the city. Our guide showed us some of the hand gestures used\nby people here and told us what they mean (eg ways to order different\ncoffees), many with similarities to Italian gestures, but slightly different\nmeanings.\n\nWe had some decent pizza at a place recommended by our guide and some ice\ncream near by (another food that's supposed to be good here, and it was). We\nhad a look around the city cathedral, which used to be the cathedral of the\ncurrent Pope. It's a bit smaller and more understated than many of the\nEuropean cathedrals I've seen.\n\nWe headed back to the hotel, mainly to try and find my hat. Rosie had had the\ngreat idea to WhatsApp the Uber driver that had brought us from the airport\nand sure enough, she had the hat. Rosie communicated with her throughout the\nday, wifi dependent and with good use of Google Translate. The hotel was the\neasiest place for us to meet, so we went back to wait and have a look at\nthings to do in the coming few days.\n\nWe went to a slightly fancier Italian restaurant for dinner and had some more\ngood bread, pasta and wine. A little after we got back to the hotel, the Uber\ndriver arrived with my hat in tow - Rosie saved the day. <R> Guys, words can't\nquite communicate how excited Daniel was to be reunited with his hat. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:25.257628	2018-10-17 17:55:25.257628	2018-04-11 11:50:00	92
93	\N	As a change from our comfortable, sunny days in the mid twenties, today was\nwet, almost constantly. As planned, we used the morning to go La Boca, but\nmaybe didn't see as much as we would have on a sunny afternoon.\n\nLa Boca (literally "the mouth") was the first port area of Buenos Aires and is\napparently a bit dodgy, but has a small, popular, touristy area (aside - I've\nheard a lot of people using "touristic" rather than "touristy" - I didn't\nrealise that was a word, so it's always a bit jarring). In that area there's\na big blue and yellow football stadium, probably the national passtime, and\na short street lined with buildings painted bright blues, greens, reds and\nyellows as if it had been built out of Lego. Various blogs and guidebooks\nsaid that it can be crowded and there are groups of people dancing tango in\nthe street, but I guess the insistent rain put paid to that today.\n\nGetting steadily more wet, we didn't stay long. We caught the bus a few stops\nup the road, hen walked through another protest to the National History\nMuseum. It was focused primarily on independence, but with bits of other\nperiods of history dotted in here and there. We were given a booklet that had\nenglish translations of **most** of the explanations throughout the galleries\nand made our way through. It was very interesting, but somewhat confusing,\npartly due to ocassional difficulties and translations and that the exhibits\nweren't necessarily chronological. The particularly intriguing bit was how the\nmuseum identified its own historical significance - it was set up in the late\n1800s as Argentina was trying to forge a single national spirit while also\nencouraging immigration from Europe. Reading between the lines, the museum\nclose to deified the figures of the independence movement to inspire unity\nthrough patriotism, but has since toned this down a bit.\n\nAfterwards we collected our bags from our hotel and, having checked out\nearlier in the morning, got an Uber (which may have been ordered to stop\noperating here ...) out from the centre to a cooking class. This was held in\nour teacher's house. Saul was an ex-economist who had decided he enjoyed\nteaching people to cook more than his day job. He had a decent kitchen and I'd\nliked the look of the menu we would cook. <R> He was very lovely and personable,\nit kind of felt like being taught how to cook by your uncle. </R>\n\nHe greeted us with a few snacks - olives, cheese, salami and some of his own\nsourghdough. He'd prepared quite a few of the ingredients for our dishes\nbeforehand, so the class was a mix of demonstration and hands-on learning,\nbut I learnt a lot.\n\nWe started with a rum and dulce de leche semifredo. He whipped the cream, then\nadded in a cap of rum per person and the dulce de leche. We scooped the\nmixture into glasses and left it to chill during the rest of the class. They\nwere great, surprisingly not too sweet, but maybe a little too rummy.\n\nMost of what we did was make empanadas. Saul had a light recipe for pastry\nmade with more water than lard and a bit of baking powder to make it a bit\nflaky. The pastry was easy to work and needed a bit of kneading, which was\nstrange to me seeing most pastry I've made has required trying to reduce the\namount of time you touch it with warm hands. We left the pastry in the fridge\nwhile we made the filling.\n\nSaul had already chopped up the ingredients, so I sauted the onions while he\ndescribed the spices and the roughly minced beef we were using. Once the sauce\nwas done it went into the fridge, too, but Saul said normally he would leave\nit to sit to slowly cool for an hour before doing so.\n\nWe then made circles of pastry by working togetjer to roll the pastry out\nusing a pasta roller. Saul showed us the versatility of the pastry by covering\nsome of the leftovers in salt and backing to create little crackers and dry\nfrying a couple of the circles to create simple tortillas that were\nsurprisingly good.\n\nWe then made empanadas by putting a dollop of filling on a pastry circle in\nour left hand, forming the filling into a denser "mountain", then slowly\njoining together the sides of the empanada, tilting our left hands and working\nfrom the bottom up. We then formed a particular crimp that apparently\nindicates that there is beef in the empanada. I wasn't particularly good and\nonly really got worse as we went on. We egg washed most of them, but left six\nplain. Once baked, they were pretty good and I actually preferred the non\negg washed ones. <R> One day I will manage a perfect crimp on a pasty or empanada\nbut today was not that day. </R>\n\nThe main course that we made was the classic Argentinian steak. Like most\nsteak seems to be here, it was huge - about 700g for the three of us (we\ndidn't finish it). Saul covered it in **a lot** of salt and seared it for a\nfew minutes on each side. He put it into a dish and covered it with some of\nthe juices from the pan and chimmichurri, then roasted it for 17 minutes on\neach side (20 minutes per pound, apparently). <R> It was lovely but there was\njust way way to much steak, I really struggled to finish my piece. I don't know\nhow the argentinians eat so much meat. </R>\n\nSaul had prepared the chimmichurri beforehand, but gave us the recipe. It is a\ntraditional sauce which we realised we'd had the previous night and enjoyed.\nSaul told us that the name "chimmichurri" is strange even here. There is a\nstory that it comes from British men a few hundred years ago seeing gauchos\n(Argentinian cowboys) preparing it, then saying "give me curry", which has\nbeen corrupted over the years. <R> This was probably my favourite part of the\nmeal, I reckon you could put chimmichurri on just about anything. </R>\n\nSaul accompanied us to the train station to get back to the centre. We had a\nbus to catch, but plenty of time. Or at least, we thought so, until our train\nrepeatedly stopped for much longer than we were supposed to. Eventually\narriving at the station, we partly walked, partly ran to the bus station, only\nto find that the organisation was a bit of a shambles - a sign said we needed\nstand 43, but someone official looking there said he didn't know where the bus\nwas supposed to be. We found the sales desk for our company, who told us it\nwould arrive between stands 14 to 25 ...\n\nWe made it onto the bus - which we were to be on for the next 15 hours. Our\nseats were very comfortable with tables that could be erected above them.\nUnfortunately they didn't recline all the way down into a bed as I thought\nthey were supposed to.\n\nThere was the end of a film (Arrival) playing in quiet English with Spanish\nsubtitles. We watched until the end, then another film started (Before I\nfall). It was on just enough that we wanted to know how it ended, but then it\nwas replaced with music stopped for dinner, which we ate some of, and then a\ngame of bingo, considerably harder in Spanish. Rosie went to sleep when\nanother bad film came on and I tried with little success to write a few diary\nentries, then got some sleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:25.533739	2018-10-17 17:55:25.533739	2018-04-11 14:10:00	93
94	\N	Still a bit tired after our bus sleep, we arrived in Mendoza in the mid\nmorning. We walked into town, finding our hostel. We had a small private room\nwith squeaky bunkbeds. We'd not eaten much on the bus and had lunch at a\nvegetarian pay-by-weight buffet, which seem to be popular (although normally\nwith meat). Rosie loaded up with tea at the nearest Starbucks, too. <R> I just\nreally needed a proper cup of tea. </R>\n\nIt's a bit cooler here than it's been so far, so we walked to the various\nparks here. The centre of the city is a large, square park, surrounded by\nfour smaller parks separated by a block or two on each corner. We sat in the\nlarger central park for a while before moving on. We made our way out to the\nmuch larger San Martin park, spending some time by the lake watching a tiny\ndog try and catch pigeons.\n\nOn our way back into town we stopped to book a wine tour for the next day and\nhave a look in a chocolate shop or two. We were stopped by a man in the centre\nof a street as we were all crossing it - he just seemed to want to have a\nbrief conversation about when he was an artist in London.\n\nAfter a quick shower, we found a decent Italian place for dinner. At 8.30pm,\nwe were the second group of people to sit down in the restaurant. Our food was\ngood (more melt-in-the-mouth gnocchi for me), but, knowing that we were going\nwine tasting the next day, we didn't order any wine. We still had a taste of\nsome as part of a promotion by a local winery in combination with the\nrestaurant.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:25.847748	2018-10-17 17:55:25.847748	2018-04-11 14:30:00	94
95	\N	One of the main things Mendoza is known for is for its vineyards and\nparticularly its Malbec. We'd booked a tour of Valle de Uco, one of the more\nfamous wine-producing areas. It's about an hour south of Mendoza, so we needed\nsome form of transport and renting a car for wine tasting didn't seem like a\ngreat idea.\n\nWe had a rushed breakfast, then were picked up in a minibus by Ampora tours.\nThere was a driver and a young tour guide along with a group of three\nAmericans. They turned out to work for Disney as salespeople and event\nmanagers in Argentina for events to promote the opening of a new part of\nDisneyworld. It turned out there was another guy on our tour, close to passed\nout on the back seat, having been out last night and not having slept.\n\nOur first bodega (a winery here) was picturesque, surrounded by vines and\nwithin sight of the snow-capped Andes. It is owned by a French family who had\nmade wine in southern France, then sold their vineyards to buy land here. A\nguide from the bodega showed us the resevoir that fed the irrigation for the\nvines, then led us into the winery itself. She showed us the steel tanks,\nconcrete tanks and French oak casks used to ferment the wine (cheaper wines in\nsteel or concrete, more expensive in oak). She then took us below to the\nbasement to see the oak barrels that the wines were aged in (the more\nexpensive the wine, the longer the time it spends in barrels and the newer the\nbarrels). Finally, she showed us the bottled wine, stored standing up if\nclosed with a fake cork or screw cap, stored lying down if corked (so that the\ncork doesn't dry out, shrink and let in some air). <R> My favourite part was\nwatching them mix the wine by pumping the liquid from the bottom of the tank\nthrough a massive sieve in a bathtub and then pumping it up over the top of\nthe tank. This causes the grape solids to mix with the liquid as apparently\nthey float after a while. </R>\n\nOur tasting was also in the basement. We had one white and three reds, not too\nmuch, but I could feel it by the end. We learnt that you should be able to\ntell a Malbec solely by its colour (slightly violet at the edges rather than\nred) and that Chardonnay is often disliked by people who dislike bananas.\n\nWe had about a 30 minute drive to the next winery and learnt that our guide,\nAlecio, had only been at the company for a week and a half. He seems to have\nhad loads of other jobs though, despite being 24, and spent a year travelling\nthrough South America.\n\nOur second winery was actually the owners' house, with the wine production\nin a huge room off the side of the house and the wine stored in the cellar.\nThe building was impressive, open and airy with lots of mirrors and local art\n(including a picture of Mickey Mouse that the Disney guys loved). It was\ncloser to the Andes and our tasting was outside with a stunning view.\n\nOur third winery was even closer to the Andes. Apparently the work of the same\narchitect as the previous one, but much larger. This was less of a tour as it\nwas primarily a six course lunch with wine pairings. I don't remember as much\nabout the wines here as I was more focused on the food and the conversation\n(now significantly loosened by the wine). The food was decent, the steak was\nlarge but not obscene and the raspberry "foam" (ice cream) was delicious.\n\nI'll admit I fell asleep for about an hour of the two-hour drive home - I\nthink only Rosie, Alecio and the driver remained awake for the whole time. It\nwas a fun day with great people, and unsurprisingly we didn't end up getting\ndinner.\n\n# Bodegas & wine tastings\n\nI preferred the ones in **bold**.\n\n## Domaine Bousquet\n1.

96	\N	We got up a little later than we meant to today, so decided to go for the\nshorter of the walks Rosie had found. We had our hostel breakfast and I tried\nto use up some not-so-nice South American Dairy Milk (made in Uruguay, I\nthink) by putting it in porridge. I really don't recommend that - stirring it\nin a bit just accentuated the nastier tastes in the chocolate, not its\ncreaminess. However, the bits that weren't stirred in were pockets of melted\nchocolate, which was decent.\n\nRosie got a travel card from the hostel which we then topped up with money so\nthat we could get some buses - they don't take cash. After some discussion, we\ngot some crackers, a soft cheese and a packet of cookies for lunch, then\ncaught the bus to the foothills of the Andes.\n\nWe followed a gravel track up a mountain which stayed pretty flat for a long\nwhile then became steep. The mountain is definitely a foothill - only 1675m\nand we probably started at 1000m or higher. Still, it was pretty steep and the\nground in front where Mendoza is built is very flat, so the view was great,\nespecially with the Andes behind it. Until we saw it from there, neither of us\nhad really appreciated how big Mendoza is.\n\nThere wasn't too much in the way of wildlife, this being essentially a desert.\nWe saw several large birds and I almost stepped on a tiny snake right at the\nstart, but otherwise saw very little.\n\nWe caught the bus back and got off near(ish) the big San Martin park to climb\nthe smaller hill there. We had a decent view of the mountain we climbed with\nthe Andes in the background (but into the sun, so the photos probably aren't\ngreat). We spent a bit of time at the independence memorial at the top, then\nwalked back into town.\n\nIt was between 6pm and 7pm at this point and I was pretty hungry, but\ntypically people don't eat here until after 8.30pm - 9pm. However, we came\nacross a restaurant (another Italian place) offering 40% off before 8.30pm,\nso they definitely wanted us to eat. Like everywhere else, it was starting to\nopen and was practically deserted.\n\nThe food was fantastic - warm bread, nice oil and vinegar, incredibly juicy\nburrata and slow roasted tomatoes and rich, cheesy baked pasta dishes. Our\nwaiter was also really good, replacing our bread whenever it was done and\nhelping us find a half bottle of wine we'd like. We left very full, but happy.\n<R> Guys the burrata was just amazing! </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:26.456458	2018-10-17 17:55:26.456458	2018-04-11 21:00:00	96
97	\N	We visited another couple of wineries today, this time in an area called\nLuyan de Cuyo. We'd both separately found recommendations to hire bikes from\nthe well named Baccus Bikes who gave us a map, recommendations for where to go\nand even booked lunch for us.\n\nLuyan de Cuyo is a little bit south of central Mendoza, so we needed to get a\nbus. We walked to one bus stop and immediately gave up as the road was blocked\noff for work. We walked to another stop and waited for 45 minutes before\ngiving up. The bus system here is a bit odd - all buses have a big number for\nthe rough area they're going to and a small number for the exact route. This\nmeans that from a distance many buses look like your bus, but end up not being\nso. After two or three buses hadn't shown up that were supposed to, we walked\nto the next bus stop and finally caught one.\n\nAfter picking up our somewhat expensive bikes, we headed to the first\nrecommendation - Carmelo Patti's winery. Apparently, Carmelo Patti is a\nstalwart of the wine scene here and he had the newspaper cutouts to display\nreviews of him and his wine from across the world. His place was quite\ndifferent to all the others we'd been to. It wasn't at a vineyard (although I\nthink he has at least one), but at a warehouse where he stores the bottles. He\nalso buys other people's grapes and creates blends there, too. In addition, at\nmost of the places we've been so far the wine has at most a year in the bottle\nbefore it is sold. Carmelo stores his for four to eight years so that people\nwho buy it don't have to do so in their own wine cellars (according to him).\n\nWe had a quick tour with three others who had also rented bikes from Baccus.\nCarmelo only speaks Spanish, so it was a bit of a test, but we got most of it.\nHe showed us that he stores the bottles in cardboard boxes and keeps the\nbottles upside down so that the cork doesn't dry out and the wine doesn't\noxidise. He told us that if we buy wine and plan on keeping it for more than a\nfew months, we should take off the wrapper around the neck to inspect the\ncork. If there is obvious discolouration in a line down the height of the\ncork, the wine will oxidise and should be drunk soon. Otherwise, the wine can\nbe stored for twenty years on its side (out of light).\n\nWe tasted three of his wines, giving him a chance to give us another tip.\nApparently it can be hard to open older bottles of wine, but if you warn the\nneck of the bottle with a lighter, the cork should become easier to remove.\nThe wines we tasted were a Malbec which had been bottled four years ago, a\nCabernet Sauvignon bottled eight years ago and a blend of Malbec, Cabernet\nSav, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. They were all quite nice, but the wines I've\nliked most so far were all younger.\n\nHis place was really busy, with people there before and after us. He seemed to\nreally enjoy teaching people about wine and in having so many guests from all\nover the world - he was particularly proud of his eleven large guest books\nwhere everyone wrote something after their visit. There was no charge for our\nvisit, either, and not even a sign outside his property saying where it was.\n\nWe didn't have far to the next winery and went with the three women we'd had\nthe tour with. I could very slightly feel the wine, but we cycled on the hard\nshoulder most of the way.\n\nThis winery, Lagarde, came highly recommended by Bridget who had been here a\nfew months ago. It's one of the older vineyards at around 110 year old. We had\nmissed the scheduled our but it was also the place we had booked lunch. Like a\nfew days ago, lunch was a six course menu with paired wines (a Viogner,\nChardonnay, Merlot, Malbec, and a sparkling blend). The food was delicious and\ninventive, but would be difficult to replicate. Two of the starters contained\nice cream - one basil, the other red pepper. The steak portion in the main\ncourse was absolutely massive, I couldn't quite finish it. Luckily, there was\nspace in the pudding stomach for the peach tart and almond praline that\nfollowed.\n\nThroughout our meal, there was a group of people at a nearby table who had\nappeared with their own photographer and videographer. It was a bit weird\nseeing how much of their meal was split up with posing for one or the other,\nbut we never really worked out who they were or what was going on.\n\nAfter our meal, despite not finishing most of my (generous) tasting glasses, I\ncould feel the wine. We spent quite a long time wandering through the\nvineyards and gardens where some of the veg we'd eaten had been grown. We saw\nplenty of olive trees dotted among the vines and flocks of birds flew between\nthem. We saw some of the irrigation channels being filled to water lines of\nvines.\n\nAfter a good while, we cycled to our last stop, a little shop called A La\nAntigua selling homemade preserves, savoury spreads and liqueurs. They also\nlet us taste many of these - including a few olive spreads, a raspberry\nvinegar and some flavoured dulce de leches. We wanted to buy something, but\napparently the border crossing to Chile is very strict. Instead, we gave them\na little bit of money.\n\nWe left back the bikes and caught a bus back to Mendoza. Completely stuffed,\nwe did not need dinner. We spent the evening searching for a pinguino in a\nfew tourist shops. Literally meaning "penguin", pinguinos are ceramic penguins\nused to hold and pour wine which we'd seen in Buenos Aires and Rosie was\nendeared with. We found what we were looking for and went back to the hostel.\nI finally added the diary entries from Australia to the site and ended up\ngoing to sleep pretty late (around 1am).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:26.731842	2018-10-17 17:55:26.731842	2018-04-11 23:20:00	97
98	\N	The plan today orignally had been to go for a longer hike to a mountain near\nwhere we'd been two days ago. We were both fairly tired when we woke and\nRosie, somewhat out of character, said she wasn't really up for a hill today.\nInstead, we had an easy day catching up on stuff and resting and I'm glad we\ndid. <R> This is going to sounds rediculous but sometimes you just need a day\nwhere you chill out. </R>\n\nWe'd done quite a lot in the past few weeks and with a bit of a break we were\nable to deal with a few things that had fallen by the wayside. I was further\nbehind with the diary than I'd ever been and, while I had added stuff to the\nsite yesterday, I'd left a bit of a mess in the Git history, so adding in the\nnext set of diary entries was going to be a pain.\n\nWe whiled away the day, writing and reading our books. We'd bought lunch\nyesterday, so had that. I tried again to improve the bar Dairy Milk I had by\nmelting it and dipping a banana into it (good, but still not great). We also\nbooked the flights for the end of our trip - from Quito to San Diego on the\n7th of June (with a nice 11 hour layover in Fort Lauderdale, can't wait), and\njust for me, from San Diego to Belfast just over a week later. We must have\nhit the sweet spot for booking flights - a Wednesday a couple of months\nbeforehand - because my flight at least was quite a bit less than the last\ntime I'd looked (just under £300). Admittedly, it's got two longish\nconnections and probably not the best transatlantic flight, but it is cheap.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to return to the place we went a couple of days ago\nwith the 40% discount. We were hungry, it was just before 7pm, we knew it would\nbe open, good value, and have delicious burrata. It wasn't as good as the\nfirst time, but it was good. Through some slight miscommunication with the\nwaiter we ended up with the same wine as last time, but we did both like it\n(Las Perdices Malbec).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:27.52575	2018-10-17 17:55:27.52575	2018-04-11 22:00:00	98
99	\N	Today was another travel day on a bus, but with spectacular views as we\ncrossed the Andes. The bus was at 10.30am, with only a little hassle and an\nenforced tip to the baggage handler, we pretty much left on time.\n\nWe had the front seats on the top deck of the bus. The front window had a kind\nof netting on it to reduce the glare, but slightly spoiling the view,\nespecially through a camera. There was also a message board and TV directly\nabove us (which played Spanish-dubbed movies throughout our journey). The side\nwindow, however, was unfettered and had a decent view.\n\nThe scenery was immense. Sharp mountains for hours on end, some snow capped,\nbut little vegetation and a crystal-clear sky. The road was decent with\nseveral long, and occasionaly poorly lit, tunnels.\n\nWe had a border crossing into Chile in the middle of the journey, which I'd\nread could be arduous, take several hours and include strict bag checks. It\nonly took about half an hour - everyone piling off the bus to get their\npassports checked, given a piece of paper, then back to the bus to grab\nluggage, hand in a customs form and put the bags through an xray, then back to\nthe bus. Easy. <R> The whole thing was so surprisingly efficient that we kept\nasking if we had done it correctly because we couldn't believe it could be that\neasy. </R>\n\nThe time flew by, particularly because we listened to the last few hours of\nA Memory of Light, the last book in The Wheel of Time series. We'd both read\nit, but we started listening to it over two years ago in January 2016.\n\nWe arrived in Chile and had a bit of a saga getting out money. The first ATMs\nwe found were inside a building that was having its glass walls cleaned, so\napparently we couldn't enter. The next one we found was broken and being\nfixed. The third wouldn't accept our cards. The fourth worked, but only after\nwe realised that, unlike any other country so far, we had to select an option\nstating that our card was foreign. Of course, after that we saw ATMs\neverywhere.\n\nWe took the subway into the city from the bus station to get to the shared\napartment in which we have a room for the night. The man at reception wasn't\nable to get a hold of anyone for a while, so we played Heads Up on Rosie's\nphone in the lobby. It was ok with two players, but is better with more.\n\nEventually, a guy came down to let us into the flat - he'd been in the pool.\nWe quickly got out our laundry and worked out where we could wash it in the\nbuilding, then changed and headed to the pool and jacuzzi as indicated on the\nsigns on every floor. They were open air pools on the roof and,\ndisappointingly, were cold. It's not that warm here, probably around 20\ndegrees Celsius at that point, but the view of Santiago at sunset was great\neven if we didn't go into the pool or non-functional jacuzzi. To add to the\ncool reception, the shower in the flat was at best lukewarm, too ...\n\nOnce our washing was done, we were pretty hungry. It was between 8pm and 9pm,\nso just when people were starting to eat here. We found a decent-looking\nItalianish place, had some pasta and a pizza and Rosie had her first pisco\nsour of South America (at least, on this trip).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:27.812291	2018-10-17 17:55:27.812291	2018-04-13 23:40:00	99
100	\N	We woke up on the hundredth day of our trip to find that our host had prepared\na breakfast of yoghurt and granola. We left soon after to transfer our bags to\na hotel nearby at which we were to meet Rosie's parents, who are going to join\nus for the next two weeks.\n\nAs we were walking, Rosie's parents happened to spot us from their taxi, so we\nboth scrambled into the taxi for the few blocks to the hotel. Once we arrived\nwe were told that the rooms were already ready - ours had two floors with the\nbathroom and a second bed upstairs, separate from the main building. <R> Also\nthe chalk board in the hotel had our names on it welcoming us to the hotel. It\nwas all really very lovely. </R>\n\nWe got the metro to a large park in the museum district, putting quite a bit\nof money on a single travel card as they can be shared here. We stopped for\ncoffee and a muffin at the cafe of an art museum and Rosie and I did our\npenalty of 85 star jumps for snacking. A month or two ago we decided to force\nourselves to do star jumps whenever we snack outside mealtimes to increase the\namount of exercise we get. We started at 50 and add 5 for each additional\nsnack. <R> The penalty has dramatically reduced the number of snacks we eat. </R>\n\nWe spent the next hour at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, which focused\non the atrocities committed during Pinochet's regime. The museum was focused\nprimarily on the events themselves rather than the history behind it. We\nlearnt that Pinochet was one of the generals that took power in 1973, bombing\nthe President's palace where the President of the time, Allende, later\ncommitted suicide. The museum detailed the forms of torture used and where\nbodies were hidden and discovered, along with the reaction of the press, the\npeople of Chile and other countries.\n\nAfter that sobering experience, we went to the old main square of Santiago and\nhad a great Peruvian lunch (I had a chicken causa with fantasticly lemony\npotato). Apparently Peruvian food is more popular here than Chilean food.\nAfterwards, beside a large group of lined-up semiformal policemen, we joined\na walking tour in English through the city.\n\nA lot of the tour focused on some of the more recent Chilean history,\nparticularly the Pinochet dictatorship. We stopped outside the presedential\npalace - apparently the only place the Chilean Air Force has ever bombed (we\nsaw the footage at the previous museum). Our guide was quite cautious because\nopinions are still divided in Chile. Some still see Pinochet as saving Chile\nfrom Allende's socialism and thank him for Chile's current relative wealth.\nAccording to our guide, when Pinochet eventually lost an election, he didn't\nfully leave power - he was still head of the military.\n\nOur tour guide was great and described quite a bit of the history, culture,\nfood and drink, savoury or otherwise. I tried a traditional drink called Mote\ncon Huesillo, a sweet drink with something like corn in it and several halves\nof dried peach. Tasty, but overly sweet. Another of the stops was at a street\nof "Coffee with legs" cafes - places which have female staff in short skirts\nand lots of mirrors so that male customers can appreciate their legs.\nApparently, this started as a way of trying to market coffee to men. Now there\nare much seedier establishments nearby, just hidden from sight, but are\noccasionally raided by the police. <R> The girls wear even less. </R>\n\nI met an interesting guy called Eric on the tour with us. He was travelling\nalone through South America between finishing a Law degree and starting work,\nbut also doing a distance Computer Science course on the side. He'd been to\nquite a few of the places we were going to, so it was good to hear his stories\n(and to briefly talk about programming).\n\nWe ended the tour at one of Pablo Neruda's houses. He was a famous Chilean\npoet, Nobel laureate and politician. We then went to a beer bar nearby at the\nrecommendation of our guide and tried a flight of beers (I mainly stuck to a\npisco sour).\n\nGetting the metro back to the hotel ended up being a lot more complicated than\nthe few stops we originally thought. After some misunderstanding, we worked\nout that during rush hour, certain trains on certain lines only stop at a\nsubset of the stations. We ended up walking a bit further after getting a red\ntrain which bypassed our green-marked station (or vice versa, I can't\nremember).\n\nWe had a great Italian meal for dinner along with several decent wines. I\nthink (writing this weeks later) this was the first point we had the Matetic\nSauvignon Blanc, which everyone liked and was probably the wine we had the\nmost in Chile.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:28.093574	2018-10-17 17:55:28.093574	2018-04-28 15:30:00	100
101	\N	Today started with a **huge** breakfast. We were asked what kind of eggs we\nwould like, then served a fruit salad, granola in yoghurt and tiny crepes with\ndulce de leche. My omelette was served with bread and I'd opted for a hot\nchocolate. Needless to say, the banana I'd had before breakfast turned out to\nbe a mistake.\n\nThe main event of the day was a tour of the only winery within the city bounds\nof Santiago, sandwiched between the city and the Andes. We got there by taxi\nand metro (with a load of football fans in the metro), then picked up bikes\nand joined a tour. <R> I was impressed with their stamina, they sang the whole\nway from the city center to the stadium and were still singing as they left the\nmetro. </R>\n\nUnlike our winery tours in Mendoza, here we were guided through the vineyards\nand allowed to taste the grapes. We had Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot and Cabernet\nSauvignon. They were all pretty sweet and juicy, smaller and rounder than\ngrapes for eating. Many had shrivelled on the vines, leaving slightly juicy\nraisins. I kept some to try alongside the wines made from them, but it was\nhard to try and taste the specific flavours the grape varieties directly gave\nto the wines.\n\nWe got an Uber back to where we'd ended our walking tour yesterday and ate at\na traditional Chilean restaurant. I had something simmilar to a cottage pie,\nbut much sweeter as the topping was corn rather than potatao and has sugar\nscattered over it. Probably not something I'll have again. <R> I had an empanada\nwhich was very tasty. </R>\n\nAfterwards, we headed up the hill nearby to get a view over the entire city.\nIt had a church at the top with a wedding going on and a large statue of Mary.\nThe view was fantastic and the free water fountains were definitely\nappreciated.\n\nDinner was more of an event than a meal. We went to a very upmarket restaurant\ncalled Borago and had a sixteen course tasting menu with seven paired wines.\nThe food was primarily made from Chilean ingredients and, unsurprisingly given\nthe number of courses, the portions were small. <R> The wine portions howeve,\nwere generous and I couldn't manage all of them. </R> None of it was like food you\nwould <R> or could, </R> replicate at home - we had the Chilean national flower with a single\ntranslucent dot of flavour placed on each petal, drank a seafood soup from a\nbull's horn and cracked a sugary sheel of a cold creme brulee like desert made\nto look like part of the stone it was served on, and each of those were only\nparts of courses. It was a pretty surreal take on food, a bit like an extreme\nversion of the few tasting menus I've had in Edinburgh.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:28.520049	2018-10-17 17:55:28.520049	2018-04-28 16:20:00	101
102	\N	After another massive breakfast (I was prepared this time), we headed for the\nMuseum of Precolumbian Art. There were examples of arts and crafts created by\nmany of the peoples from all over Latin America before European influence,\nwith a specific exhibition on the Atacama and on Chile (including Easter\nisland). For me, one of the most interesting pieces was an Incan form of\nstoring information by connecting many cords together and tying knots in them\nin particular places.\n\nWe then picked up a car which Michael and Clare had rented and had a seafood\nlunch, before driving out of the city and up into the mountains in search of a\nwalk. We ended up in a kind of resort campsite that did have walks available,\nbut they were over a bridge that shut shortly before we arrived. There wasn't\nmuch evidence of any easily accessible trails or paths nearby, so we walked\nthrough the campsite and down to the river, then back up. On the drive back we\ndid get to see a brilliant sunset down the bottom of the valley.\n\nWe had some more Peruvian food for dinner with gigantic portions. I had rice\nand beans covered with a slab of steak and accompanied by plaintain and an\noniony salad. It barely looked like I had eaten any by the time I had to give\nup. We shared a starter with quite a few different dishes including a\nbizarre pink salt that was close to eating a little bit of bleach or ammonia.\nThe Chilean Merlot, however, was great.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:29.090897	2018-10-17 17:55:29.090897	2018-04-28 18:20:00	102
103	\N	We spent the morning (after another huge breakfast) driving from Santiago to\nValparaiso, the main port town near(ish) Santiago. Santiago is a gridlike,\nobviously planned and reasonably flat city. Valparaiso is nothing like it.\nIt's a sprawling mass of multicoloured buildings flowing over dozens of\nsteep hills.\n\nWe stayed in a little hotel perched on top of one of the central hills, hidden\nin a maze of thin one-way streets. Both rooms had small balconies overlooking\nthe Pacific, but only one was ready for us, so we left everything in one room\nbefore leaving to look around the city.\n\nValparaiso is incredibly colourful, similar to La Boca in Argentina. Both are\ndue to buildings being painted with cheap paint left over from ships. Ships\nare painted with bright colours so that they can be seen, so the city ended\nup bright blues and yellows and greens. In addition to the bright coloured\nwalls, Valparaiso has a strong tradition of street art and graffiti. There are\nsome very impressive pieces of art dotted around, both large and small. Some\nlast for years, others are replaced within months.\n\nWe spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon looking at the art, then\nhad a seafood lunch at a restaurant near the harbour. Afterwards we joined a\nwalking tour of the city, focusing primarily on the street art, but also\nexplaining the importance of the port through the history of Chile (and the\nSan Francisco gold rush). We used some of the hundred year old lifts or\nsmall furnicular railways in the centre of the city to get up the steep hills\nfor a token fee.\n\nAfter the tour, we rode up another lift to view the modern shipping port,\nwatching lorries bring in containers and cranes take containers off a huge\nship. As it approached dusk, we went back to the hotel, had our complimentary\nwelcome drink, then walked to a nearby restaurant with a great view over the\ncity and excellent food.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:29.620847	2018-10-17 17:55:29.620847	2018-04-28 20:50:00	103
104	\N	We got up early to catch a bus to the fishmarket to have a look at what was on\noffer. There wasn't a huge haul on show, but we stil saw plenty of different\nfish. By the sea, there were flocks of gulls, several pelicans and half a\ndozen giant sea lions swimming in the shallow water below the pier. <R> I was\nparticularly amused by the Chilean sea bass which was so different to sea bass\nI am used to that I wonder how it got the same name. </R>\n\nWe had breakfast back at the hotel, then checked out and drove to another of\nPablo Neruda's houses. It was a strange, five storey building filled with\ntrinkets Pablo Neruda had collected and a horde of tourists following their\naudio guides from floor to floor. We parked nearby and immediately a man on\nthe street demanded 2000 pesos ($3/£2.50) to "take care of" the car. A stall\nowner beside us quietly told us not to do so and eventually the other man left\nus alone.\n\nWe drove back to Santiago, dropping the car off at the airport as we caught a\nplane north to Calama. We collected another rental car, a 4x4, then drove for\nanother hour through the Atacama desert towards San Pedro de Atacama.\n\nJust before arriving, we stopped at the entrance to a National Park called the\nValley of the Moon, a strange, lunar landscape of reddish rock spread out\nbelow a cliff that we could view it from. The sun slowly set at the end of the\ncliff face, casting a brilliant light across the valley and lengthening the\nshadows of the sharp rocks jutting out from the valley floor. <R> It was a\npretty amazing view and timed very well. </R>\n\nWe arrived at a small town of orangy-brown adobe buildings, checking into a\nhotel with a pool in a central courtyard. We walked into town and had a\ndelicious dinner in another courtyard with a fire near our table.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:30.473184	2018-10-17 17:55:30.473184	2018-04-28 21:00:00	104
105	\N	Despite the fact that it was offered, I resisted the temptation of lemon\nmeringue pie for breakfast, opting for yoghurt and muesli instead.\n\nAfter breakfast we drove out of town to one of the salt flats around an hour\naway. As we approached, the cry, desert landscape suddenly was covered in\ngreen scrub before giving way to a barren, white landscape. Near where we\nparked was a shallow brine lake with quite a few birds including several\nspecies of flamingoes. We walked alongside the lake, taking pictures of the\nbirds and occasionally the tiny white lizards that weren't afraid of us at\nall. <R> One lunged at Daniel as he tried to film it before scurrying away. </R>\n\nWe continued into the desert, stopping further down the salt flats to have a\nbit of a walk and saw several wild mules or donkeys along with evidence of\nsomething burrowing into the sand.\n\nWe drove on towards the mountains, stopping at a small village for a lunch of\nsoup. We drove higher, probably reaching over 4,000 metres, stopping at a pair\nof lagoons. We could definitely feel the altitude, making it necessary to\nbreathe more deeply. We saw quite a few vicuna, like llamas but thinner and\nnot domesticated. What they were eating was hard to determine - they seemed to\navoid the clumps of grass and found something edible in the gravel.\n\nDriving back down we saw a lot more than on the way up. We saw red-tinged\ncacti that we'd missed before and a big group of ostrich-like rhea walking\nthrough them. Near by, we saw a desert fox and its cub, not shy of our car at\nall. We stopped for a walk in a canyon before the village we'd had lunch\nwhere Rosie got a few great shots of a falcon, then we got a brief sighting of\na condor on the way back to the tower. <R> We also tried, and failed ot get the\ndrone working again. </R>\n\nThe drive back was long, allowing us to fully appreciate the scale of the\ndesert. The slope down from the mountains was gradual, leading onto a massive\nplain bounded only on the horizon by another set of mountains. We stopped at\nthe salt flats where we'd seen flamingoes to catch the incredible sunset on\nthe brine lake.\n\nWe had a great dinner where I tried a Chilean cocktail that I wouldn't really\nrecommend - a terremoto or "earthquake". It consists of bad, cheap browny\nwhite wine (sold in 5 litre bottles) with pineapple ice cream and fernet.\nSweet, sickly and pretty weird.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:30.940134	2018-10-17 17:55:30.940134	2018-04-29 12:30:00	105
106	\N	Today I gave in and had a slice of the lemon meringue pie. Like the ones in\nArgentina, it had an emphasis on soft meringue, and not particularly tart\nlemon.\n\nWe rented some bikes (three almost brand new bikes and one with some clear\nwear) and cycled out to the Valle de la Luna which we had seen at sunset a few\ndays ago. There was paved road until the valley, then the path deteriorated\ninto gravel and sand. We cycled through the valley, stopping every so often at\ndifferent places pointed out on a map we'd got at the entrance. We climbed\nthrough salt caves, up rocky hills and sand dunes and earned some fantastic\nviews over the bleak landscape.\n\nWe cycled to the end of the valley to see a strange rock formation that we all\nagreed probably weren't worth the slog back up the bumpy hill in the heat. It\nwas a bit quicker getting back to the start as it was mainly down hill and\nthere was the promise of cool water or Fanta at the end. After a stop for the\ndrinks, we got back on the tarmac road and dropped off the bikes where we'd\ngot them.\n\nWe spent the afternoon planning the start of our time in Bolivia after having\na bit of ice cream in the main square. We had another good dinner with savoury\nprofiteroles and a traditional tres leches dessert.\n\nAfter dinner we had a stargazing tour booked. We were picked up and driven out\nfrom the town a bit to reduce the effect of the slight light pollution. Our\nvery enthusiastic guide set up telescopes to let us look at the moon, then\ngave us a talk about the history of astronomy and some of the principles of\nsome of the telescopes we were using. We learnt about the constellations and\nhow to use the Southern Cross to find which direction is south. It turns out\nour guide had previously worked on the telescopes at ALMA, the massive\ninternational telescope located nearby, high in the Atacama desert.\n\nThere were a few tables of snacks and drinks provided, along with heaters and\nblankets. Through the telescopes we saw galaxies, nebula, binary stars, Mars,\nJupiter and Saturn. Rosie was able to borrow a camera lense to take a few\nfantastic shots of the Milky Way.\n\nHowever, we had originally had planned to get up around 6am tomorrow to go and\nsee geysers at dawn, but the class was taking quite a long time. We finally\nended at 2am and scrapped the idea of an early morning.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:31.70802	2018-10-17 17:55:31.70802	2018-04-29 13:20:00	106
107	\N	No lemon meringue pie this morning - it was replaced with an interesting\nraspberry pie. After that, Rosie and I booked our onwards tour into Bolivia\nfrom a tour operator in town, then we got in the car and the four of us drove\nto the Tatio geysers.\n\nThe geysers are an hour or two from San Pedro de Atacama and up at around\n4,300m. Almost all of the tours aim to get there at dawn for the better light\nand the increased activity, but also meant that by arriving around noon we\navoided the crowds. In fact, a whole caravan of 10-15 minivans and 4x4s came\npast us on their way back as we made our way there.\n\nThe geysers were small, but continuously boiling patches of water with plumes\nof steam reaching metres above them. There were quite a few dotted around the\nplace and a hot spring fed pool which we took advantage of after lunch. In the\npool, we met three Chilean ladies (who live in Argentina, meaning their\nSpanish was very hard to understand). They had big balls of mud and encouraged\nus to rub it on our faces and shoulders. Afterwards, they broke into a couple\nof Beatles' songs. <R> They were great, not sure about the mud though. </R>\n\nOn the way back, we stopped at the Valley of the Dead, also known as Mars\nValley, just beside the Valley of the Moon. It got one of its names from the\nfact that a Mars rover had been tested in it as it has a comparable landscape.\nWe drove into the valley, parking on the sand and walking up onto a plateau\nwith a view down onto spiky volcanic hills and the massive sand dune we\neventually ran down to get back to the car.\n\nWe'd booked an AirBnB for our last day in San Pedro after Rosie's parents had\nleft, but for some reason the guy renting it out refused to tell us the\naddress. We needed to know it so we could arrange our onward transport, so\ntried to get him to tell us it until he cancelled. Very strange. We found a\ncheap hostel anyway.\n\nWe also moved into a different hotel, more of a resort than the previous one\nwith separate buildings for each room, slightly out of town. We bought a\ncouple of bags to make it easier to give some of our stuff to Rosie's parents\nto take back. We had another good dinner, finishing with a chanar cake, made\nfrom a local plant which can be used to produce a sweet flavour.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:32.385137	2018-10-17 17:55:32.385137	2018-04-29 14:20:00	107
108	\N	\n<R>\nToday's post is written by a ghost who I'm 90% sure does not read the blog\nbut is none the less an active supporter of RnD travels. It covers our entire\ntime in Chile but focuses on today.\n</R>\n\nFor the Chilean section of our travels, we signed up with McJack’s Pretty Good\nAdventures Tour group. They are a pretty small operation specializing in bespoke\nitineraries. I feel we have to rate them pretty highly, importantly their rates are very\ncompetitive, and secondly they are Rosie’s parents, and even though I am fairly sure they\ndon’t read this blog, they just might.\n\nWithin 24 hours in Santiago we had enjoyed a good meal and more than 12 varietals of wine,\ndon’t worry they were all locally sourced. Some were good, some were excellent,\nwhile they all tasted like wine other flavors that were mentioned, (raspberries, peaches,\nvanilla, tobacco and others) however none of us were able to catch the hints of dusty roads\nand sweaty horses so often found in wines from the neighboring Argentinean region of Malbec. The\nfavoured wine of the week, we checked for consistency by testing several bottles\nover the course of several days, was a Sauvignon Blanc from Matetic Viña, not only\ndoes it have a pale bright color with green hues, an intense mineral and herbal nose,\nit is full of citrus aromas. The plate is fresh and juicy with good acidity, volume and a\nlong elegant finish; it also has a really cool label.\n\nSantiago is a very large sprawling city with many hills, having visited the museum of\nMemory and Human Rights (a sad but compelling catalogue of events from the time\nof the Pinocet dictatorship) and a few of the sites around Bellavista and Cerro San\nCristobel our phone had clocked 9.1 miles an 69 flights of stairs.\n\nThe coastal town of Valparaiso, about 2 hour drive from Santiago is a curious town\nconsisting of 45 cerros (hills) that surround a shipping port, each hill forms a\ndistinct community, many in the old town are tiny, very steep the easiest way to get\nfrom one to another is by using the 100 year old funicular system. Street\nartists brightly and intensely decorate the ramshackle and slightly run down streets.\nWhile many are political, there is in general a light air to most of the murals think\nBanks without the attitude.\n\nWe greatly enjoyed a visit to the restored museum and former home of Chili’s most\nfamous poet Pablo Neruda in Valparaiso, judging by the eclectic style in which it is\ndecorated I can’t help feeling he would have greatly enjoyed the street art that can\nnow be seen from his quirky home.\n\nAll McJack’s nearly good adventures involve a walk, it is usually the signature event\nof their trips and this one was only different in the sense that it seemed it was going\nto be rather modest: A 3-4 kilometer walk with a 1000m gain. What could possibly\ngo wrong? The only anticipated problem was the altitude, but what’s 5,550 meters\n(18,000 feet) when you are with friends.\n\nAll started off well, and just so you are not worried, ended well. Some of the bits\nin the middle, however, were a little suspect. The day started with a sound breakfast at which\nDan and Michael slipped a small supply of cakes and biscuits into their pockets.\n2 Litres of water per person - check. Factor 55, 75, 100 suncreen - check.\nEmpanadas - check. Down loaded maps - check. There are 2 routes to Lascar Volcano,\nlet’s just say for reasons that were never clear we took the route less travelled.\nWe turned off the main road and were bumping along a bumpy but passable track,\nwe had a 4 wheel drive and were happy to make us of it.\n\nShortly after leaving the main road we needed to do a little bit road building, we\nthrew a few rocks into a small gulley and we were quickly back on the bumpy but\npassable track. Then we turned a corner to find that the track had deteriorated into\na very narrow steep ledge, rocks on one side, rocks the ground, no rocks on the\nother side just rather a lot of air and a rather steep drop. Rosie got out to clear a few\nrocks from the road. Michael, the driver, got out and said “well what do you think\nguys, can we make it down there?” Clare and Dan got out, we don’t know whether\nthey were thinking they could help guide the car down the very narrow and steep\nledge, whether it would be better if someone was available to go for help if the car\nslid and rolled over and landed upside in the valley below. Or maybe they just didn’t\nwant to be in the car if it slid and rolled over and landed upside in the valley below.\nNo one said it out loud but more than one of us calculated that from the top portion\nthe car could perhaps flip fully over and roll back upside right, from lower down the\nslope it would probably only have enough height to roll over onto the roof. One\nthing that was said, once Michael had skillfully and gingerly negotiated the car down\nthe slope, there was no way, as in no way, to get back up. On this we were all\nagreed.\n\nFor the next few kilometers, they felt like miles, we bumped along without a\nproblem, we passed an abandoned car, and as we crossed onto the shoulder of\nLascar Volcano, we could see car tracks heading towards the place we planned to\nstart hiking. Even better than car tracks, we saw a moving car heading in the same\ndirection as us. As we drove higher up the volcano side it got steeper and Michael\nswapped back down to 4 wheel drive, gradually the car got slower, and slower and\nthen it had no power, we could hear the engine, we could see the see the lights but\nthe car had no power. "Oh well" said Clare "we can walk from here". When we got out, the\naltimeter read above 16,000 feet. At this altitude the effective oxygen concentration\nis ~10% this may explain both Clare’s devil may care attitude and the fact that the\ndiesel powered car we were driving had given up the ghost.\n\nHaving driven to 16,300 feet it was mere 2,000 feet gain to get to the crater. That’s\nthe equivalent of parking on the glaciar at Kilimanjaro and then wandering a couple of km\nto the summit. Not so fast my friend, and that’s exactly how we hiked to the caldera,\nnot so fast my friend. Slowly, slowly, we reached the edge of the enormous\nsulphurous carter I will let the pictures speak for the view. As we\nsurveyed the scene, took photos and savoured the moment we each noticed that the\nothers were a behaving a bit odd, nothing dramatic just a bit dopey or clumsey and\ndefinitely getting a bit to close to the edge, the funny thing is I felt fine and didn’t\nunderstand why the others thought I was a getting too close the edge. I think\nperhaps the combination of low oxygen and high sulphur gases was messing with\ntheir minds.\n\nThe descent was surprising difficult but we were soon back at the car which started\nno problems, gaining power as we descended, and we speed along the path more\ntraveled back to the main road. As we headed back to San Pedro to Atacama we\nstopped to pick up a hitch-hicker, an articulate young woman who had been out\nrock climbing for the day. She is a local adventure tour guide and provided us with\nlots of information about interesting places we could go and things we could see. We\ntold her that we had been to Lascar for day, she smiled knowingly and we thought it\nwas a smile of approval signifying that she was impressed that we had navigated\nthe route and successfully slogged our way to the top without a local guide. We\nchatted along, we discussed the crowds of tourists that collect at certain times of day\nat certain sites. We remarked on how isolated and alone we were at Lascar, just\nbefore we dropped her off, our friendly local guide casually told us that there were\nno tourists at Lascar at the moment because it had experienced an increase in\nsignature warning events and that the government had closed access and that a 5km\nring around the carter was restricted. I can’t imagine how we missed volcano alert\nsystem from our check list. Nor what those other fools where doing on ths side of an\nactive volacano.\n\n<R>\nFor those that are unaware, while this may sound like a particuarly bizzare\nadventure, it is fairly normal occurance when travling with McJacks pretty good\nadventures. We received free passage on this adventure for our honest opinion,\nhowever in the interest of keeping the peace I shall let you make up your own\nmind.\n</R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:32.952039	2018-10-17 17:55:32.952039	2018-04-29 23:30:00	108
109	\N	This was Clare and Michael's last day. We swapped some items, Rosie gaining\nher boots and some clothes while they lightened our load by taking back some\nof our souvenirs. <R> Thanks guys! </R> We had a few trip admin tasks to take care of (mainly\nlaundry), then had a few hours left.\n\nWe drove to another canyon near by and spent a while clambering through a\nlong, thin cave (our phone torches came in handy). Nearby were the ruins of a\nfort from before the Spanish conquest, perched on top of the rock at the foot\nof the valley.\n\nAfter some souvenir shopping, we had lunch (some the largest slices of quiche\nI've ever seen), then said goodbye to Michael and Clare at our hostel for the\nnight. We spent the remainder of the day planning bits of Bolivia, Peru and\nEcuador, booking a trek in Peru and accommodation in Bolivia. I had a\ndisjointed call home over the patchy wifi before an interesting cheap dinner,\nthen we got some Bolivian money and turned in for the night.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:33.512218	2018-10-17 17:55:33.512218	2018-04-29 15:40:00	109
110	\N	We were picked up a little after 7am by a minibus headed for the Bolivian\nborder. It should have taken about 40 minutes, but an accident on the road\nahead of us meant that we spent an hour at a standstill.\n\nThe border was high, open and chilly. The Bolivian side was noticeably run\ndown compared to the Chilean side, but it was all pretty efficient. We had a\nsurprisingly good breakfast of bread, cheese, ham and avocado with biscuits\nand hot drinks. There were several minibuses of us and we were separated into\ngroups of six, one group per 4x4. We clambered into the back of one with a\ncouple from London called Wilson and Sita, an Australian called Caitlin and\nan American called Didi who'd been studying in Sydney with Caitlin, and our\ndriver, Leo. We'd probably been grouped by our native language, but it turned\nout to be a good group. <R> We were particuarly glad to not have been paired\nwith one of the two groups of Brazilians, who seemed nice enough but litterally\nnever stopped talking. </R>\n\nOur first two stops were at high altitude lagoons, one significantly whiter\nand another much greener, due to the mineral contents. We overtook a group\nof cyclists later and met them when we stopped at some hot springs - they were\ncycling most of the length of South America and spending eight days crossing\nthe Atacama. We had lunch at the springs (also really good), then headed on.\n\nThere was a lot of driving, so we got through a good chunk of our audiobook.\nWe stopped for a short time at a Dali-esque desert, followed by a set of\ngeysers. The wind was strong, causing the fumaroles to look like fog over the\nground while the odd bit of snow gusted about us.\n\nWe had a longer walk at the "laguna colorada", a very red lake filled with\nflamingoes with green algae and white salt. On our way to the village we were\nto stay in, we stopped to help another 4x4 which had broken down (not the last\ntime over our three-day trip). At the village, Leo  <R> our driver </R> was very happy to get us\nall double rooms despite the tour operator stating that we would be sharing a\ndorm. He made us all a delicious dinner before we went to sleep. <R> At this\npoint we had all decided that Leo was the best. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:33.84018	2018-10-17 17:55:33.84018	2018-04-29 16:00:00	110
111	\N	Surprisingly, despite sleeping at nearly 4,000m we slept really well. We had\npancakes with dulce de le (of course) for breakfast, then brought our stuff\nout to the car.\n\nAfter a false start (Leo forgot his phone), we got off for a brief drive,\nstopping at a "rock city" nearby. It was a large formation of volcanic rock,\nprobably formed from lava flows. They were fun and easy to climb, so we spent\na good half an hour there. The other car from the day before had broken down\nagain, so we ended up spending a bit more time there, sitting in the shade of\nthe rocks.\n\nOur car took a couple of tries before it started, but it did work eventually.\nWe didn't have far to go before stopping to get photos of a camel-shaped rock.\nI don't think the plan had been to be there for long, but unfortunately our\ncar wouldn't start again. Luckily, the tour company we went with had three\nother cars which traveled with us. All the drivers crowded around the car's\nhood, then took out the seats in the middle of the car to get at some of the\nelectrics. Leo suggested that we walk to another set of rocks nearby, so we\ndid. We spent about an hour walking over, climbing up the rocks and listening\nto a bit of the Wheel of Time in the shade. When the six of us decided to\nreturn to the car it was still a hive of activity. A couple of the drivers\nset up lunch for us while the others worked. Leo returned to last night's\nvillage to get a part, then came back. He also phoned for a replacement car,\nbut finally, thankfully, the car started.\n\nBack in a working car, we set off in convoy. We probably skipped one or two\nstops originally scheduled for today, but we did still visit a few more\nsights. One was a small marsh within another rocky landscape, grazed by llamas\nand leading to an almost black lagoon. Another was a deep canyon with a\ncurving river running through it and precipices out into it that gave a good\nview. There was still a good deal of driving, so we finished the prequel to\nthe Wheel of Time part way through the day. The last stop was at a shop that\nsold quinoa beer and cactus beer - according to the people around who actually\nlike beer, eg Rosie, the quinoa beer was surprisingly good.\n\nFor the night, we stayed in a salt hotel - a building partly made from salt\nand with salt sculptures on the wall. We had hot showers, a simple but tasty\nthree course meal accompanied by wine (and coke). We had an early night due\nto the promise of an early morning and electricity that turned off at 10pm.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:34.322472	2018-10-17 17:55:34.322472	2018-04-29 20:00:00	111
112	\N	Our last day of the tour was the one we'd most been anticipating - the Salar\nde Uyuni or the salt flats of Uyuni, a 4,000 square mile area of white salt.\nWe arrived before sunset, stopping in an area with a thin layer of water. The\ncolours of the sunrise were incredible, especially reflected in the ground\nbelow us - probably the most spectacular sunrise I have ever seen.\n\nWe didn't spend too long in the cold, but drove on to an island pushed up out\nof the salt. It was covered in giant cacti and had a great view over the\nflats, so we spent around an hour there. After walking around it and taking\nphotos, we had a breakfast of yoghurt, roast quinoa and cake. We took\nadvantage of the pure white ground to take perspective-trick photos. Soon, Leo\ngot us back in the car, driving us further into the centre of the flats to\ntake even better photos. We spent a good while taking a variety of photos and\nended up with some pretty convincing ones. <R> I have to say that while the photos\nwere fun to take it was the sheer size of the salt flats that was the most\nimpressive for me. I've never seen anything so flat, so white and so big. If\nyou ever get the chance to go to the salt flats I can promise that it is totally\nunique. </R>\n\nWe stopped again at (apparently) the first salt hotel in the world, which was\na bit of a dump. It did allow us to take the best perspective photo we got -\na tiny Rosie appearing to stand on my hand. We then had an obligatory stop\nat a local market (we only bought a few postcards), then had lunch in Uyuni,\nour final destination.\n\nAfter food (and a brief reintroduction to wifi - it silenced our entire group\nafter three days without it), we drove back out of Uyuni to a "train cemetery"\n(exactly what it sounds like), then were dropped off at the office of a bus\ncompany. <R> I still don't know exactly why there was a train cemetery there. </R>\n\nWe were dropped off around 4pm and had an overnight bus at 10pm to Sucre.\nCaitlin and Didi were staying in Uyuni for the night, but Wilson and Sita\ndecided to get the bus. They bought their tickets at the office, but we'd\nbooked ours online. Apparently we needed to print them out, so we spent\n30-45 minutes trying to find somewhere to print our ticket. Eventually we\nfound an internet cafe filled with kids playing computer games, a primary\nteacher printing out tomorrow's teaching aids and a couple of worried-looking\ntravellers.\n\nWilson and Sita had looked after our bags back at the office. Once we rejoined\nthem we looked up the recommended restaurants in our guide book and found\nsomewhere with board games. We were the only people in it when we found it,\nbut we had a relaxed three and a half hours with a couple of pizzas, a bad\npisco sour and some pretty decent mulled wine ("vino caliente" is pretty\ncommon in Bolivia). We had a long game of Ludo (which I probably haven't\nplayed in 15 years)- Rosie won and came third by the skin of my teeth.\n\nThis was the third night bus of our trip and was definitely the middle in\nquality. The seats weren't the most comfortable, there weren't any films or\nfood, but then again we could sit up, recline our seats and no one was\nsleeping partly on me and partly in the aisle. <R> It was exactly what you would\nexpect a night bus to be, uncomfortable, not particuarly restful but it got us\nfrom point A to point B with no real problems. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:34.969562	2018-10-17 17:55:34.969562	2018-04-29 21:00:00	112
113	\N	Unsurprisingly, we didn't sleep well on the bus. <R> Daniel slept, and snored\nto prove it... </R> It arrived at 5.30am (why is that an acceptable time to\narrive? That's when we arrived in Luang Prabang, too). We got a taxi to our\nhostel and got our first taste of how cheap Bolivia is - £1 for an early\nmorning 15 minute taxi journey.\n\nOur hostel owner was great, letting us in that early in the morning and even\nthough our room wasn't ready, she let us sleep in an empty dormitory and let\nus have breakfast when we woke.\n\nSlightly more awake, we moved into our actual room, booked flights for our\nnext journey in a few days time (giving ourselves a few nights' good sleep),\nthen planned our couple of days in Sucre.\n\nWe walked a few blocks to the centre of town and sampled some of what Sucre\nis known for - cheap, good quality chocolate. My kind of place. We ate them\nin the main square and had a bitof an unpleasant experience - a young boy came\nover offering to shine our (very dusty) shoes, which we refused, then an old\nman came begging. He was uncomfortably close and quickly became violent\ntowards the boy, who narrowly avoided being hit. We stood up and I walked\naway and, slowly, so did the man.\n\nWe were slightly unsettled, but then spotted Wilson and Sita. We learnt they\nwere staying nearby, then made vague plans to meet up later in the next day or\ntwo. We left them and had an arepa and a cachapa for lunch - Venezualan\npancakes with assorted fillings.\n\nSucre is the original capital of Bolivia and retains the centre of the\njudicial system (so there are "Abogado" signs everywhere). The centre of\ngovernment moved to La Paz after a civil war, but Sucre has quite a lot of\nhistorical significance. It's a white city with orange tiled rooves, a grid\nof streets and tiny pavements (clearly not designed for cars). It was\noriginally a colonial city, built near enough to the mountain silver mines in\nPotosi <R> but low enough that the spaniards didn't collapse all the time. </R>\n\nOne of the important historical sites is the place where the Bolivian\nDeclaration of Independence was signed. We had a tour of the building,\noriginally built by the Jesuits (who were very important in early Bolivian\ncolonial history). We learnt that Bolivia was originally much larger, with\nland lost in repeated wars with its neighbours. The most keenly felt loss is\nclearly their Pacific shore - they'd obviously like to regain access to the\nocean.\n\nWe watched the sunset from the Mirador cafe up the main hill in the Recoleta\ndistrict with a few drinks. It was a good view, but not the best sunset we've\nseen. On the way down, we found an empty French-inspired restaurant with good\nfood and a very flamboyant <R> and slightly drunk </R> waiter.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:35.707362	2018-10-17 17:55:35.707362	2018-04-29 21:30:00	113
114	\N	The main other attraction for us in Sucre was the Cretaceous Park. We met up\nwith Wilson and Sita and shared a taxi up to it (another cheap journey).\n\nThe park was (and still is) a quarry for a cement factory. Some time ago they\nstopped excavating one wall due to the increased amount of magnesium in the\nlimestone. Underneath that layer, hundreds of dinosaur footprints were found\n- supposedly the largest palaelogical site in the world. This has been\ndeveloped into a park with life size replicas of dinosaurs, complete with\nloudspeakers playing Jurasic Park dinosaur calls.\n\nWe had a tour of the quarry, showing us hundreds of footprints beloning to\nfour distinct groups of dinosaurs. The most impressive were the huge, circular\nsauropod tracks and the smaller, pointier teropods (mainly carnivores). <R> I\nwas most impressed by the fact that the guide could group them into the 4 distinct\ngroups, move of them looked like blobs to me, although some were very well\npreserved. </R>\n\nAfterwards, a Spanish-speaking guy offered us all a lift in the back of his\npickup which we accepted (once we understood). He dropped us nearish the\ncentre, but we got a taxi to avoid walking the thin roads. Wilson and Sita\nshowed us a great fruit juice stall in the central market, with a wide\nselection of cheap fruit and a free refill.\n\nWe searched together in vain for several recommended lunch places, then left\nWilson and Sita and bought some salteñas (large empanadas) at a nearby bakery.\nOk, so we also had some sweet treats too. We followed this up with a\n"chocolate espresso" (a chocolate shot), a speciality of the chocolate shop\nChocolates Para Ti we'd visited earlier.\n\nWe spent the afternoon at the Treasure Museum, learning more about how gold,\nsilver, copper and gemstones were (and still are) mined in Bolivia.\nParticularly interesting was bolivianita - a combination of amythest and\ncitrine, found only in Bolivia. <R> They are clearly very proud of it. </R>\n\nWhile we were in the museum, loud bangs sounded in the central plaza outside.\nAccording to our guide in the museum, loud protests like this are common in\nSucre and we'll see more when we make it to La Paz. Everything had calmed\ndown by the time we left, though.\n\nWe spent the end of the afternoon at our hostel and the park outside with a\nsmaller replica (orange) Eiffel tower. I tried to phone Rowan, but ended up\njust texting him due to lack of decent internet. Rosie and I had a decent\nItalian meal (great gnocchi) in a small restaurant beside a big group of\nEnglish-speakers currently attending a Spanish school - popular here because\nBolivia is cheap and Bolivians speak very clearly, if quickly.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:36.744107	2018-10-17 17:55:36.744107	2018-04-29 22:10:00	114
117	\N	We had the same breakfast as yesterday - salteñas and cinnamon tea. We checked\nout of our hostel, leaving our luggage there and after a bit of a faff caught\nthe bus to the botanical gardens at the edge of the city.\n\nThe gardens are really quite large - mainly forest, but with some organised\ngardens. We saw plenty of animals: massive butterflies, a big red squirrel,\nseveral large birds of prey, lots of smaller birds, and a sloth. Several\nthings we've read call Santa Cruz the "unofficial sloth capital of the world"\nand Rosie was particularly keen to see one. Luckily, she got her wish, even if\nthe sloth wasn't posing particularly photogenically. <R> We saw a sloth!! </R>\n\nWe got the bus back into the city to pick up our laundry, but it wasn't yet\nready despite what they had agreed with Rosie two days ago. Rosie had earlier\nfound a well-reviewed cafe a couple of streets away. We had an excellent early\ndinner of crepes and fajitas along with a minty pineapple juice recommended\nby the owner. <R> The owner is my new best friend, she was so lovely. </R>\n\nWe picked up our laundry, then collected our luggage and got a taxi to the\nairport. We quickly got through security and killed a couple of hours with\nthe Wheel of Time and Pokemon Emerald, with a little programming thrown in.\n\nThe flight was quick and fine, landing in el Alto area of La Paz at about\n4,000m of elevation. La Paz is situated in a valley and has overflowed its\nboundaries, meaning that some of it is at 3,100m and some is at 4,000m and\nthere are some very steep hills. We got our first sight of this as our taxi\nrounded a corner and the bowl of La Paz was spread out glittering below us in\nthe night.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:38.362438	2018-10-17 17:55:38.362438	2018-05-01 21:40:00	117
118	\N	Breakfast was provided by our hotel, but was relatively simple. This probably\nshouldn't be that surprising as we learnt later that people here typically\neat five times a day (yes, people in Bolivia do seem to be somewhat rounder\nthan in Chile and Argentine, but that is also partly due to that being\nattractive in some indigenous groups).\n\nWe spent the morning seeing La Paz by teleferico (cable car). These are a\npretty cheap form of public transport ($0.40/£0.30) built in 2014 and being\nextended that give great views over the city. They also really made us\nquestion why anyone would build a city here (answer: originally, gold was\nfound in the river in the valley). La Paz really does seem to be a unique\ncity - at such a high altitude, surrounded by steep, snow-covered mountains\nand sharp rock formations. The telefericos just accentuate it.\n\nWe planned to join a walking tour so didn't have long for lunch. We ended up\nstumbling upon a great place for choripan - the sausage-in-a-bun snack that\nwe'd first had in Argentina, but somehow a lot better here, I'm not sure why.\nTopped off with a dulce de leche filled donut and some strawberry yoghurt, it\nwas a good lunch. <R> Everything seems shut when we tried to find lunch, which\nwe later learned was because may 1st is a bank holiday here. </R>\n\nThe walking tour pointed out some of the weirder aspects of La Paz. First\nthere was the prison where inmates run the prison and have to pay for\neverything, so have jobs inside and even their families live inside. Some\nprisoners used to charge people to give them tours (possibly with cocaine),\nbut these are now illegal.\n\nAnother odd part was the witches' market - a mixture of tourist tat and things\nused for rituals by indigenous people. For example, for small constructions\nlike shops it is customary to get an offering of sugar, alcohol and a llama\nfoetus and bury it all in the foundations to prevent bad things happening\nduring the construction. Apparently larger constructions may require human\nsacrifice and while this is obviously illegal it isn't really known whether\nit still happens, but we were warned against getting blind drunk or accepting\nfood or drink from strangers in case we end up being buried alive as a\nsacrifice ... <R> Apparently pacha mama prefers blondes and apparently even\nDaniel is considered blonde in Bolivia. </R>\n\nAfter the tour we had a bit of a wander (Rosie bought an alpaca sweater), then\nhad a beer and a cocktail from the national spirit, singani. It was good we\nwere inside - it began to bucket with hail and snow mixed in. We watched the\ntraffic and noticed that the majority of vehicles are taxis or minibuses,\nwhich is fair enough, driving up these hills doesn't look like fun.\n\nWe then joined a food tour by the same company as our earlier tour with one\nof the same guides. Because it is May Day, lots of places are closed, so a\ncouple of courses weren't included in the tour, but we still finished stuffed.\nWe had a lot of food, all pretty good:\n\n* **Pastel** - a  deep fried cheese pastry typically covered in icing sugar (better than it sounds)\n* **Api** - a warm, sweet white or purple corn drink, spiced with clove and maybe cinnamon\n* **Llajwa** - a spicy tomato sauce or dip served with most restaurant meals\n* **Singani sour** - like a Pisco sour, but with Singani (we got to mix one ourselves)\n* **Pique macho** - A massive pile of chips, beef, sausage, bolied egg, cheese and spicy sauce\n\nWe also had some Bolivian versions of popular food and drink - Bolivian beer,\nwine, brownies (ie, with quinoa) and apple crumble (also with quinoa). Since\nthe growth in popularity of quinoa in the UK and US, it's more expensive here\nand harder to get - our guide said he used to have it four times a week in his\nchildhood but now only once a month.\n\nWe got a taxi back to the hotel because most people don't recommend walking\nafter dark. We're only supposed to get taxis with phone numbers on the side\nand signs on top - the others are apparently not trustworthy. It's amazing\nhow normal it now seems that taxis don't have working seatbelts, too ...\n	2018-10-17 17:55:39.046508	2018-10-17 17:55:39.046508	2018-05-01 22:30:00	118
119	\N	We were up in time for the end of breakfast (10am), then spent the rest of the\nmorning on the telefericos. They give great views of the city and we hadn't\nbeen on all of them yesterday. The two extra we went on today (the white line\nand orange line) were the best - one just above a main road, the other going\nup and over a large hill. We decided they'd make a great focal point of an\nopening chase scene of a Bond film and spent a while trying to work out how\nit should play out.\n\nOnce we got hungry, we got off the cable cars and found a few different places\nto get some delicious baked goods for lunch. Because it was nearby, we then\ntook a tour of the St Francis museum which, as far as we could tell from the\nguide, is still a functioning Fransiscan convent. The church also incorporates\nindigenous art including depictions of their deities. The view from the roof\nwasn't as spectacular as you'd expect for a large church because it's located\nalmost at the bottom of the bowl of the city.\n\nWe spent the afternoon shopping somewhat successfully for souvenirs, then\nless successfully going to a museum. It was shut, and not just for the two and\na half hour lunch break everyone has here. We headed back to the hotel and got\nin a little bit of Pokemon before dinner.\n\nDinner had been bokked by Rosie weeks ago. It was a vegan restaurant that only\noffered tasting menus - we opted for the seven course version and shared the\npaired drinks (some wine, a couple of cocktails and a beer). The food was\nprimarily made from Bolivian ingredients - lots of corn, potatoes and quinoa.\nIt was interesting, but definitely not replicable, and I wasn't overly full\nat the end. Unfortunately for Rosie, both deserts involved bananas (the\nstrawberry and banana sorbet was fantastic). We also happened to bump into\nCaitlin and Didi from our Uyuni tour there, too.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:39.812814	2018-10-17 17:55:39.812814	2018-05-03 17:50:00	119
120	\N	We were up early to get a taxi at 6.30am. Or so we thought - the taxi was\npretty late and we had a bus to catch, so we had a tense start to the day.\n\nWe did make it to the bus run by Bolivia Hop, the bus company we'll be\ntraveling with for the next few weeks. They drove us from La Paz to Copacabana\non the shore of lake Titicaca with a brief stop for breakfast and another to\ntake a ferry across a small part of the lake. <R> It was slightly bizare to\nwatch the bus get loaded onto a small barge and slowly moved across the narrow\ngap between the 2 bits of land.\n\nWhen we arrived we bumped into Wilson and Sita from our Uyuni trip. They're\nalso leaving tomorrow, but not staying in the next couple of places we're\nstopping. We dropped off our stuff at our hostel for the night, then went out\nto find lunch.\n\nWe ended up at an upmarket hotel/restaurant with a view over the bay and the\ntown. The main reason we went was for the promise of cheese fondue, which did\nnot disappoint. We then slowly walked up the hill behind the town, feeling the\naltitude with every step.\n\nWe spent most of the afternoon on a rooftop terrace near the water writing\npostcards. We got them free with the last set of stamps we bought, so they\nwere all from Indonesia. We retreated back to our hostel after we finished\nwriting and it began to get cold.\n\nWe had dinner at one of the more highly recommended places in the town. I had\nfajitas with brilliant refried beans. Rosie had traditional trout from the\nlake, which is one of the specialities of the town. <R> It was delicious. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:40.240145	2018-10-17 17:55:40.240145	2018-05-03 21:30:00	120
121	\N	We were up and had breakfast in time to get the 8.30am boat from Copacabana to\nla Isla del Sol. The journey took about an hour and a half on a reasonable\nspeed boat packed full of people (we passed the time with a wee bit more\nPokemon, beating the elite four).\n\nDespite being called the island of the sun, when we arrived it was hailing.\nHail turned to rain, which in turn fizzled out in about fifteen minutes. We\nwaited it out, then headed up onto the island proper.\n\nRosie felt she recognised the island from her previous trip to the area, but\nwe've since realised that it's just because it's similar. The islands are\nsteep and we spent quite a while climbing up the steps to the ridge. We took\nour time - the lake is at 3,810m and the ridge is at about 4,000m. We saw a\nfew llamas and some local people setting out their wares after the showers. We\nwalked to the top of a couple of hills around the town in the south of the\nisland, getting some great views. The rest of the island is out of bounds to\ntourists at the moment due to a local dispute - something about one group\nbuilding on top of another group's sacred site, then the wronged party\nresponding by blowing up the offending building with dynamite.\n\nWe had lunch with a great view over lake Titicaca. A lot of places here offer\na set menu, so we had soup, trout and dessert (drowned in Hersheys' chocolate\nsauce, unfortunately). Everywhere has trout and we found out that it's\noriginally Canadian and was introduced.\n\nWe got the bus back with enough time to pick up our luggage and return to the\ndock to catch our bus (and also to squeeze in a strawberry and banana shake).\nWe met Wilson and Sita who were also getting the same bus as us, but not\nstaying in Puno. We all got on the bus once it arrived and headed for the\nborder.\n\nThis was one of the last borders of our trip, but not the easiest. We arrived\nat the Bolivian side and had to leave the bus with all of our luggage as we\nwere to get on another bus, owned by the same company, on the other side. We\nlined up to go through customs and changed our remaining Bolivianos into\nPeruvian Soles. Some confusion arose when we were told to have our entry slips\nready along with our passports. We hadn't been given an entry slip and neither\nhad quite a few others. One of the officials (<R> we think </R>) took Sita's passport and told her\nthat she would have to pay 50 Bolivianos, but no one else in the same\nsituation had to pay. Wilson took back the passport and our guide from the bus\ncompany talked to the official, but didn't get much information. We ended up\ngetting through without anyone paying, so we're pretty sure the official was\njust hoping that Sita didn't speak enough Spanish to understand and would\nhave just handed over the money. The guide said she'd never seen this in her\ntwo years there. <R> I also overheard the guide ringing the main company to\ntell them about the incident so hopefully someone officially complains about\nthis as its very unkind and particularly panic inducing to have someone take\nyour passport away in a forgein country. </R>\n\nThe Peruvian side was a bit more official, but equally frustrating. I got\nthrough fine, but Rosie had trouble switching passports. As she's a US\ncitizen, she should enter the US on her US passport, but until now we've both\nbeen using UK passports to make things simpler (and cheaper in Bolivia).\nWe're flying into Ecuador and from Ecuador to the US, so needed to register\npassports, so it makes sense for that one to be Rosie's US one. Having left\nBolivia, it should be possible to switch passport and enter Peru on the US\none, but the customs official insisted on only accepting the passport with the\nBolivian exit stamp, which should not be necessary as far as we can tell.\nWe'll sort it out at the next border. <R> It was fine, just annoying. </R>\n\nOnce through the border and onto our fancier, double decker Peruvian bus, we\nsaw a fantastic sunset and listened to our audiobook for the couple of hours\nto Puno. When we arrived, we were bundled onto a shuttle bus, which squeezed\nits way through the tiny streets, stopping a couple of blocks from our hotel\non the main pedestrianised street. The hotel was pretty nice and the prices\non the wall were more than twice than what we'd reserved online.\n\nWe got some cash out of an ATM (sadly one with foreign transaction charges),\nthen scouted out dinner. We ended up at another place with a set menu, the\nbest pisco sour Rosie's had in a while and a great mulled wine and pisco\ndrink with some kind of fruit juice to sweeten it slightly, served in a hot\nceramic mug.\n\n**Note** The last four or five days are missing photos - Rosie is on it, but\nwe haven't had good enough internet for the last few days to upload & link\nthem.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:40.788551	2018-10-17 17:55:40.788551	2018-05-05 16:30:00	121
122	\N	For the first time in what feels like ages we had a decent shower available\nthis morning. It was hot, had good pressure and we didn't have to decide on\none or the other (a lot of the showers recently have only been reasonably warm\nif the pressure was really low). Even better, it remained hot for the entire\nshower. <R> The only problem with it was that it made the entire bathroom wet\nas well, but I'm not complaining. </R>\n\nAs we're in Peru for pretty much a month, Rosie really wanted to have mobile\ndata available. She'd found a coule of providers and we went to find their\nshops. They all seemed packed full of people queueing, so we joined the line\nin a slightly emptier one. Once we reached the front, the woman serving us\nseemed not to have sold a SIM to a non-Peruvian before, so it took a while.\nTime was getting short as we had a tour booked, so I left to go and buy lunch\n(at a delicious bakery near our hotel).\n\n<R> After finding someone who did know\nhow to sell a sim to a non-Peruvian she slowly managed to fill out the form\nwhile I sat there silently (and then probably not so silently) panicking that\nI was not going to make it back in time. She finally managed to fill out all\nthe required forms, which needed my finger print, before sending me over to another\nplace to pay and a third to actually pick up the sim. She assured me all was fine\n(although two days later the sim still hasn't activated) and I ran (sprinted) out\nof the shop, I had exacly 1 minutes to get 10 minutes across town at 3,800 meters.\nFortunately I managed to flag a taxi and after some confusion (mainly due to me\nbeing very out of breath) he dropped me at the closest place a car can get to\nour hotel. I sprinted the last 500m and dropped panting into a sofa at the hotel.\nI do not recommend sprinting around at this altitude no matter how acclimatized\nyou think you are.\n</R>\n\nRosie arrived, panting from her rush back to the hotel, five minutes before\nsomeone came to pick us up for our tour. The main thing to do from Puno is to\nsee the floating islands on lake Titicaca (or "Titihaha in the local language)\nmade out of reeds, so we got on a bout full of other tourists for a half hour\ntrip to the Uros floating islands.\n\nWe disembarked onto a reed island with a slightly weird texture under foot. We\ngathered together on a reed bench while our guide and the island's president\ntold us about the island. There were 21 people living on it and there are\naround 90 islands, each with their own president. The island is built from\n1.5m deep blocks of reed roots in earth, held together with stakes and rope\nfor a few months until the roots join the blocks together. Then a further 1.5m\nmetres of reeds are piled on top to make a platform, then reed huts built on\ntop of even higher reed piles. The floor of the island is replenished with\nreeds every fifteen days.\n\nThe people of the islands survive on tourism, so we had a look at their\nvarious handicrafts and paid for a trip in the large catamaran reed boat (kept\nafloat by several thousand empty plastic bottles in the hulls, then wrapped\nwith reeds and decorated with slightly demonic reed cats' heads at the front).\nSeveral of the larger buildings, probably not made from reeds, were the three\nprimary schools. For further education, all the kids need to go to Puno.\n\nOur last stop was a larger island with some small shops and restaurants. We\ngot a passport stamp (by the sounds of it an idea copied from Cusco, but a\ndecent stamp none the less) and plenty of photos. Rosie found that she could\nbuy Cheetos, a US brand not easily found in the UK, so we enjoyed a packet\nof them before getting back on the boat.\n\nBack in Puno, we spent a long time in the cafe part of the bakery I'd bought\nlunch at. They had wifi and a plug, so I passed the time getting the diary up\nto date and programming.\n\nIt was raining when we left, but our chosen restaurant was very close by. We\nhad a really good meal, especially my alpaca steak in a sweetish red wine\nsauce with raisins and excelllent mashed potatoes. It was pretty cold, so the\nglass tankards of mulled wine also helped. <R> A tankard of mulled wine is quite\nalot of mulled wine though. </R>\n\nWe returned to our hotel to get picked up for our evening bus. We waited in\nthe small lobby while a Spanish-dubbed CGI film played. It was a ridiculous\nfilm about, as far as we could tell, a bullfighter who didn't want to kill the\nbull, but it was hilarious in how over the top parts of it were.\n\nWe were picked up in a minibus around 9pm. The minibus quickly filled up,\nincluding one girl who seemed really pretty sick and her friend who wasn't\nquite sure what to do. Rosie gave her some antacids and some advice, but there\nwasn't much else we could do.\n\nThe bus was a bit of a disappointment. The company we've booked half of our\nbuses here with claims to be the best, but doesn't quite live up to that\nclaim. Rosie's seatbelt didn't work on one and my footrest didn't extend\ntoday, but worst so far was that our overnight bus, from 9.30pm to 5am,\nstopped at midnight and we had to change buses. This completely disrupted an\nalready bad night's sleep and doesn't endear us to the company ...\n	2018-10-17 17:55:41.225838	2018-10-17 17:55:41.225838	2018-05-07 10:40:00	122
123	\N	Somewhat disgruntled, we were herdedoff our long distance bus onto a minibus\nat 5am, only to realise that our hostel was just around the corner and we\ncould have walked there faster. Someone sleepily let us in, but check in had\nto wait until 7am, which is fair enough. Rosie tried unsuccessfully to sleep\non a small sofa while I spent the time programming until we could check in and\nwere given a room.\n\nWe ventured out to the local market for breakfast, getting a couple of large\nportions of fruit blended with evaporated milk as we had had in Bolivia (just\nmore expensive). We came back to the hotel and found that the showers were\nlukewarm at best ...\n\nWe went out for lunch to a cheap place with a set two-course lunch, but after\na soup of potatoes, rice and a bit of meat we were already full (well, almost\n- we still had space for some apple pie <R> and a cup of tea </R>).\n\nWe joined a walking tour for the remainder of the afternoon. The guide seemed\nsomewhat distracted, so it wasn't the best tour we've been on, but it was\nfine. We saw the huge white cathedral and many old, white buildings built from\nsillar, a white volcanic stone, and had some great views of the three massive\nvolcanoes nearby. Arequipa is only at 2,300m while some of the volcanoes are\nabove 6,000m, so they're pretty intimidating. <R> The fact that they are less\nthank 20 km away and still active adds to the intimidation factor. <R> We saw\nalpacas and llamas and our guide explained the differences between them and\nvicuñas (focussing on the fact that vicuñas produce the finest fabric and are\nendangered, so the fabric is very expensive and you get five years in prison\nfor killing one). We tried a local corn dirnk and a beer, then some local ice\ncream. The speciality is "helado queso", or cheese ice cream, but it is\nactually flavoured with vanilla, cinnamon and maybe some honey or other\nspices. The reference to cheese is to do with the look and method of\nproduction, apparently, much to the bewilderment of one of the Dutch guys on\nthe tour who just couldn't comprehend this.\n\nWe had another great dinner - Rosie had duck with raspberry sauce while I had\nbeef with blue cheese sauce, both delicious. The one waiter for the restaurant\nwas fantasitc, making all the drinks and gave Rosie a huge glass of wine\nbecause there was only about a glass and a half left in the bottle. We finished\njust after 8pm, but were exhausted so almost immediately went to sleep when\nwe got back to the hotel.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:41.905757	2018-10-17 17:55:41.905757	2018-05-07 11:00:00	123
124	\N	We have quite a bit of time in Arequipa, so today was a slow day. We spent the\nmorning dealing with the site - adding photos, writing diary entries and\nprogramming (adding info about the food we've eaten).\n\nWe left the hostel at lunch, getting some more fruit shakes from the local\nmarket and a couple of empanadas for lunch. We sat for a while in the central\nsquare (they always seem to be "Plaza del Armas"), then had a look around a\ncolonial house's courtyards and posted some postcards.\n\nWe spent around an hour at one of the main museums, which focuses on a "mummy"\nof a 12-14 year old girl ("Juanita") discovered on a volcano near Arequipa and\nbelieved to be a 500 year old Incan human sacrifice. There was a twenty minute\nvideo, then a guided tour culminating in seeing Juanita's frozen corpse. She's\nnot actually a mummy, but a frozen corpse due to being sacrificed at above\n6,000m. Her face was exposed, so has dried out, but apparently still has\nmuscle, all organs and frozen blood inside. The fact that the Incans could\nmake it up to that altitude with all the kit to for a sacrificial ceremony is\npretty impressive, even if it is pretty macabre.\n\nWe returned to the main square and had a pisco sours on one of the balcony\nrestaurants overlooking the plaza, then returned to our hostel to get warmer\njackets. On the way we heard the dulcet tones of "Under the sea" from Disney's\nThe Little Mermaid blasted from a bin lorry. Over the course of the day, we\nheard this maybe six times from presumably the same lorry, from midday until\nafter dinner. It was pretty baffling - why were they playing that song? Why\nthe same song over and over? Why did they take the entire day just to collect\nrubbish in a two-block radius of the Plaza del Armas? Weird. <R> Anywhere else\nplaying under the sea that many times might seem like asking for trouble but I\nsuppose at just under 2,500m they feel safe. </R>\n\nWe had dinner at a slightly fancier restaurant with a (deserved) reputation\nfor large portions (I had a starter which was an entire stuffed pepper and a\nslab of potato gratin). The food was excellent and I just had enough room for\npudding. I'm a sucker for dessert tasting platters and all four of the\ndesserts served in jam jars were interesting and tasty (although I'm still\nyet to find a lemon meringue pie here with any bite). \n	2018-10-17 17:55:42.535268	2018-10-17 17:55:42.535268	2018-05-09 10:20:00	124
125	\N	The major tourist attraction near Arequipa is Colca Canyon, a valley often\nmarketed as twice as deep as the Grand Canyon and a great place to see Andean\ncondors. Rosie had already been, but we were both still keen to go.\n\nThere are lots of ways to see it, but we opted for a one-day tour. This had\nthe drawback of starting at **3am**, meaning we had the earliest start of\nour trip so far: 2.45am. Eugh.\n\nWe got in a bus around 3.15am, and tried to sleep, but to no avail. It didn't\nhelp that we went up to 4,910m, meaning that our inflatable travel pillows\nrepeatedly needed air let out of them. After 6.30am, the inevitable tourist\nstops started, but were pretty interesting: a viewpoint at the highest point,\na view of the mountain which is where the Amazon river officially starts, and\na church in a local village (where Rosie was able to get a photo of the\nsquirrel on an alpaca).\n\nThe best stop by far, and our main reason for going on the tour, was to see\nthe condors. It was higher up in the canyon and when we arrived there were\nbetween ten and twenty condors soaring above the hordes of people and\nminibuses. The birds were huge and flew surprisingly close, almost rendering\nRosie's binoculars useless. Rosie got some decent photos and through the\nbinoculars I got a couple of reasonable videos of condors in flight and a shot\nof one on the ground. It wasn't just condors, either - we also saw a couple of\nviscachas, somehwere between rabbits, squirrels and kangaroos (apparently). <R>\nThey are so cute, especially with their little tail movements. </R>\n\nOn the way back were a few more stops - some hot springs with a rope bridge\nover a river (someone else dropped & lost their bag), another viewpoint over\nthe valley to see the terraces, a stop to taste particular cacti ("tuna") and\na surprisingly decent buffet lunch. It included some form of greenery\ndeep fried in tempura batter which was delicious and extremely popular.\n\nWe arrived back in Arequipa at 4.30pm, maybe having acheived half an hour of\nsleep between us. We booked our bus to Cusco in a couple of days with a bit of\nfaff, then had a huge Italian dinner (just Rosie's lasagne provided us with\nenough leftovers for both of us for lunch tomorrow).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:42.990822	2018-10-17 17:55:42.990822	2018-05-09 10:40:00	125
126	\N	On our last day in Arequipa we didn't have to much left that we wanted to do\nthat we hadn't already done. We spent the morning using the hostel's wifi - so\nI could do a bit more programming and Rosie could do a bit of prep for a call\nwith her lab in Edinburgh in the next few days. We had the leftovers of\nRosie's lasagne from last night for lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, we headed out to get Rosie a SIM card as her previous one still\nhasn't activated. This time it was a much easier process and the card was\nactivated immediately.\n\nWe continued on into town, returning to Mundo Alpaca (Aplpaca World), stopping\nin a small park to have a few pastries. We met the alpacas again  <R> they are\njust so fluffy and adorable </R> and Rosie got\nherself an alpaca jumper (50% off). We shopped for a few more souvenirs on the\nway back to the hotel, returning to the internet.\n\nWe had dinner at a restaurant Rosie had been to before called Zig Zag. I had\none of its specialities - three hunks of meat (beef, alpaca and pork) served\nsizzling on a volcanic rock. The alpaca was the most flavoursome and juiciest.\nThey also offered small chocolate truffles as a dessert, which I appreciated.\n\nBack at the hotel, we published our work for the day - my programming and\nRosie's latest video of our trip - then packed to leave tomorrow.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:43.63429	2018-10-17 17:55:43.63429	2018-05-11 15:30:00	126
127	\N	Almost all of our waking time today was spent on a bus to Cusco: 9.30am to\n10pm. The bus was 90 minutes late, partly due to some sort of local holiday\nand celebration that added to traffic. We did get to hear some music and see\nsome dancing.\n\nThe low point of the day was somewhere in the middle when we arrived at an\nintermediary bus station. Two other tourists (gringos) got off the bus, having\napparently been told we had half an hour there. I got off and asked an\nofficial-looking guy nearby who said we had five minutes. I quickly went to\nthe toilet and replenished our snack supplies, but when I returned to the\nstand the bus was gone ...\n\n<R>\nMeanwhile on the bus which was trying to leave without Daniel I and\nanother women who's boyfriend had also got off to go to the toilet had a shouting\nmatch with the conductor trying to force him to wait for them. He kept shouting\nback that he had a schedual to keep and that we were already late. In the end\nhe said that he would drive round to the front of the bus station and wait for\nthem there. I made the point that Daniel didn't know the bus would be out front\nbut everyone on the bus told me it would be ok and a large number of women\ntried to confort me saying that they would make the bus driver wait. I was still\npretty panicked.\n</R>\n\nPeople nearby told me to go to the other side of the station, so I ran. The\nbus wasn't there, but multiple people told me to wait. The bus pulled around\nthe corner in a few minutes and reluctantly stopped for me. The conductor\nclearly wasn't happy, but let me on.\n\nThere was no sign of the other people who'd got off and the passengers seemed\nto be divided between being strongly in favour of leaving and strongly in\nfavour of waiting, but very vocal either way. Twenty minutes down the road the\nbus stopped after the driver had received a call, telling him to wait until\nthe two managed to get a taxi to the bus. Needless to say, many of the\npassengers weren't amused.\n\n<R>\nHands down worst bus conductor ever!\n</R>\n\nA long time later we got to Cusco. We got a taxi to our hotel, were let in by\npresumably the owner, then went to sleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:44.432723	2018-10-17 17:55:44.432723	2018-05-11 21:40:00	127
128	\N	We had one day in Cusco before our 5 day trek (starting tomorrow). We'd booked\nwhere we were staying for the two nights before and the night after the trek,\nso were pretty disappointed to discover that the showers didn't heat up much\nhigher than lukewarm ...\n\nWe walked to the office of our trek organisers (Llama Path), searching for\nATMs on the way to get money out to pay for it. Unfortunately, most ATMs seem\nto limit each card to 400 soles ($120/£90) withdrawal per day, so we were\nforced to dip into our emergency US dollars to pay for part of the trek.\nGrumble.\n\n~~The main reason Rosie wanted to come back to Peru was to go back to Los\nPerros restaurant.~~ <R> Not true, but it is a good restaraunt. </R>\nFrom her previous visits to Cusco, Rosie knew of a great\nrestaurant called Los Perros near the centre, so we headed there for lunch.\nWe had wantons, potato skins and yuca with a variety of dips, including a\nspectacular guacamole, and a pumpkin soup. It lived up to all of Rosie's\nearlier praise.\n\nWe then had a bit of a wander around Cusco, not really looking for major\nattractions as we knew we'd have time to see them after the trek. We saw some\nof the impressive Incan walls built from huge blocks of granite carved to fit\nexactly together without mortar.\n\nThe best discovery on our wanderings was a small chocolate museum where we\nwere given plenty of tastings, including a sample of a fantastic 70% dark\nchocolate. We booked a chocolate workshop with them for when we get back in a\nweek's time. I'm already looking forward to it.\n\nWe went back to the hotel to finalise some planning before the trek and to try\nand get the diary up to date (and almost succeeding - only today ended up\nbeing written after the trek). Then we had a briefing at Llama Path, running\nthrough the itinerary, introducing the group (or at least the 8 out of 12 who\nwere there) and the main guide, Jose. We also were given a bright red\ndrawstring bag each in which we could put 5kg of kit to be carried by horses\nor porters during the trek. <R> Jose was interesting, we'll see how thats goes. </R>\n\nWe made our way back to the hotel, buying a pair of walking poles for me (to\nreduce knee problems) and getting a decent dinner overlooking the Plaza de\nArmas. We loaded up on trekking snacks and packed our bags, ready for our\nearly morning start.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:44.939724	2018-10-17 17:55:44.939724	2018-05-18 17:10:00	128
129	\N	We were up at 4.30am to get to our pick up spot for 5am, with a quick\n(unsuccessful) attempt to withdraw a bit more soles (Aside: "sol" is\npronounced "soul", which makes talking about how much things cost amusing -\n"How much is it to use the toilet?" "One soul.").\n\nWe were picked up in a large bright red bus and told that we had a two hour\ndrive, so could sleep. Ten minutes later we were herded out of the bus to see\nthe porters' accommodation. I'm glad that they are provided for (apparently\nthis didn't used to be the case between treks), but I didn't feel the need to\nsee it first hand, especially early in the morning when the porter could\notherwise be sleeping.\n\nWe stopped in a small village for breakfast where we started to get to know\nthe rest of the group. There were two other couples - Catriona and Phillipe,\nfrom the US, and Clare and Andy, from China and Taiwan - and six others -\nCarleigh and Eva from the US, Eric and Stu from Canada, Tom from Germany and\nFrank from Australia.\n\nAfter breakfast, we got back on the bus to go to the starting point along with\na small fleet of other buses. The road became steeper, thinner and very\nwindy with fantastic views and sharp drops. We were surrounded by imposing\nmountains with the occassional snow cap in the distance.\n\nEventually we reached the start and piled out of the bus, which promptly\nperformed an impressive 3-point turn in very little space. We had a fairly\nsteep climb to start us off, but quickly reached a tiny channel of water about\na handspan in width which was apparently an Incan canal. We followed this for\nthe next hour and a half, meaning the path was pretty flat. <R> At this point\nJose started to tell us about the flora, fauna and history of the area. I was\npretty impressed with his knowledge, right up until he told me that peru had\ngiven potatoes to the Irish just after WWII because they were hungry. After that\npoint I viewed everything he told me with a healthy amount of suspicion. Which\nturned out to be a good view because there were many other interesting\n(read: wrong) facts through out the trip.</R>\n\nWe stopped further up the valley where our tents had already been set up\nbeside some small buildings. Someone had a deck of cards and a group of us\nplayed a couple of hands of President with quite different rules:\n* twos are the highest card\n* you **have** to play higher than the previous card played\n* if you pass once, you can't play until the next round\n* the three of clubs starts\n* if three consecutive cards are played, the last person can say "run" to\n  force all following cards to also be consecutive\n* jokers can be played to beat anything (one joker beats a pair or triple)\n\nWe then had lunch, which was fantastic. The food would have been great even if\nI hadn't known it had been prepared in a hut in the middle of nowhere. We had\nthree courses: starter, soup and main course, which itself was four separate\nplatters. For me the highlight was the starter - a chicken and mango ceviche\n(yes, you read that right, no, the chicken wasn't raw).\n\nAfter lunch we (slowly) walked up to a glacial lake at about 4,100m. It was\njust below a glacier topping the nearest mountain and was a deep blue. The\nsteep incline gave a lot of us a taste of the altitude and it was a bit of a\nslog. The way down was a lot of quicker, but that may have had something to do\nwith the imposing dark clouds making their way up the valley towards us.\n\nWe made it to the huts just before the heavens opened. We were provided with\nhot tea, milo (malted chocolate drink), and salted popcorn. I'd heavily\nrecommend salted popcorn covered in milo powder - it's great after a day of\nwalking. This was followed by another great meal: soup, four platters and a\ndessert - banana flambe, served **on fire**. Amazing.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:46.087708	2018-10-17 17:55:46.087708	2018-05-18 18:00:00	129
130	\N	This was the longest day of our trek and also the highest point. We were\nwakened at 5am by one of the porters offering us coca tea to help with the\naltitude. We packed up our stuff and had a warm breakfast (potatoes, sausages,\ncake, jam, tea, hot chocolate).\n\nThe morning was spent walking up the valley along with the various other\ngroups on the same trek. We were occassionally passed by teams of horses as we\ntook our time with the altitude. The views were stunning and it was good to\nchat with the other members of the group. The only negative was that I learnt\nthat trying to find the most discrete place to go to the toilet on a popular\nhiking trail inevitably means finding an unpleasant mess.\n\nWith the help of a few snacks we made it up to Salkantay Pass, the saddle\nbelow the huge, snow-covered Salkantay mountain, rising another 1,500m above\nus. We had more coca tea and cheese (queso fresco, sadly) sandwich and took a\nlot of photos. All downhill from there onwards.\n\nWe had lunch several hours later after spotting a condor in the clouds high\nabove us. It was another great meal and an enjoyable break from walking.\n\nAfter lunch it was on down the valley. The environment very quickly changed\nfrom just grass with the occassional flowers low to the ground and views of\nsnow to a warmer cloud forest teeming with life. Jose told us this was\nessentially the upper part of the Amazon rainforest. The lower we went the\nlarger the trees became, the wider the variety of colours of flowers and the\nmore insects and hummingbirds became visible. The snowcaps were soon lost to\nsight, hidden by clouds above us. By the end of the walk there were some\nstunning swaths of bright yellow flowers on both sides of the valley.\n\nWe finished the walk at an altitude of around 2,900m and the entire group was\nonly about 20 minutes apart from first to last. We had another decent meal\nand a smaller group of us stayed up for a bit chatting and laughing, buoyed up\nby our day's achievement and the relative luxury of being able to lie in until\n6am tomorrow.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:46.987245	2018-10-17 17:55:46.987245	2018-05-18 18:20:00	130
131	\N	We were woken up at 6am this time, again with coca tea. We were quite a bit\nlower than last night so it had been warmer - quite a few of the group had had\ntrouble sleeping the night before, but were better off last night. I woke up\nwith a bit of a sore throat, but luckily Rosie's knee was a bit better (it\nhadn't been great towards the end of our long downhill yesterday).\n\nToday's walk was almost entirely a gradual downhill path. Soon after leaving\nwe came across one of the many paid toilets (one sol), but this one was\nactually good. So far it's been almost a rule that the more you pay for a\ntoilet, the worse it is. Surprisingly, this one had a toilet seat, toilet\npaper, soap and was clean, none of which are expected. Everyone was happy,\nespecially after the previous campsites facilities (a ceramic hole in the\nground). Apologies for the details of this paragraph, but after a few days\nwalking and with limited access, these things become pretty important.\n\nThe views on the walk were good and the group was really fun, so we both ended\nup in different places within he group throughout the day and chatted quite a\nbit. We saw plenty of large butterflies and even a small snakeskin on the\npath.\n\nWe finished our walking for the day at La Playa (no, it's not a beach) and had\nlunch. Everyone was impressed at the animals made out of fruit that adorned\nour main course platters - they were very impressive. After eating we played\na large game of President with eight people - things change around pretty\nquickly, even with two decks.\n\nFor most of us, the afternoon's activity was to visit the nearby hot springs.\n"Nearby" meant an hour down the windy gravel road to the base of the valley\nin a minibus. The driver had a long playlist of songs from the 1990s and\n2000s, meaning from most of our childhoods and teenage years. Pretty quickly\nwe were all singing along to most of them, taking our minds off the steep\ndrop to our side.\n\nWe whiled away a couple of hours in the hottest of the pools at the hot\nsprings, glorious after a couple of days of walking without showers. There was\none pool even hotter about the size of a bathtub that was even hotter which\nwe all tried - you could see the warm water trickling out of the rocks.\n\nOn the way back up we had more of a singalong (except to a couple of the\nout of place explicit rap songs). We had another decent dinner with a very\nimpressive chocolate cake to finish. We didn't quite finish it, but it did go\nvery well with some milo sauce on it.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:47.726359	2018-10-17 17:55:47.726359	2018-05-19 18:10:00	131
132	\N	We had another 5am start as today was another long day, if not as high as our\nsecond day. The morning was a steep uphill slog, getting up to a ridge. The\naim of this was to get to a small set of Incan ruins called Lloctapata with a\nview across another valley to Machu Picchu. At least, that was the idea, but\nwhen we arrived the view was hidden by clouds. Jose explained some of the\nsignificance of the buildings (probably religious buildings for a\nself-sufficient town) and he cloud slowly lifted, showing us the ruined city\nin the distance. <R> He also told us that Alexandar the great was roman. </R>\n\nIt was a steeper, slippier way down where my walking poles came in handy,\ndespite repeatedly slowly decreasing in size. We arrived at a small town near\na hydroelectric plant and had our final lunch of the trip - with another set\nof fantastic fruit animals. We said goodbye to our porters and our chef,\nCesar, then followed the railway line to Machu Picchu town (with a few trains\npassing us on the way). On the way we had a brief view of the walls of Machu\nPicchu high above us.\n\nWe checked into a hotel and had a well-earned shower. Well, Rosie did while I\nwaited for our luggage to arrive. Unfortunately that meant I only had a couple\nof minutes of a properly hot shower ...\n\nWe spent a bit of time using the wifi before heading out to dinner at a nearby\nrestaurant, which was ok but not great. We had an early night after a lot of\nwalking and with the earliest morning of our trek to follow.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:48.647463	2018-10-17 17:55:48.647463	2018-05-19 21:10:00	132
133	\N	The culmination of our trek was the trip to Machu Picchu. Unfortunately, this\ninvolved getting up at 4.10am to queue for a bus, getting one after 5.30am and\ninto Machu Picchu sometime after 6am.\n\nJose gave us a two-hour tour, showing us the different sections and\narchitecture in the city. Apparently it had probably supported around 2,500\npeople, which is why only 2,500 people are allowed in at any one time. That,\nand the fact that part of the city is slowly sinking. We saw the terraces of\nthe agricultural section and various drainage systems to deal with the large\namount of rain (more than Glasgow). The walls of the temples of the sun, water\nand earth were particularly impressive, incorporating some of the huge chunks\nof granite along with perfectly carved blocks in walls without mortar. Jose\nbrought us to one of the quarries, showing us several methods that were used\nto shape the stone. Most of the stones were brought to the site of a new\nbuilding then shaped using haematite tools brought from far away.\n\nOur tour finished with twenty minutes to make it to the start of our booked\nwalk for the day. At the altitude and with all the one way systems in place,\nwe just made it in time for he 10am cutoff. We'd booked to climb Machu Picchu\nmountain (which Machu Picchu is named after - the original name is lost). This\nis the larger of the two mountains you can climb at the site, and less popular\nso still had tickets.\n\nThe walk turned out to be harder and steeper than we expected. It was pretty\nmuch steps the entire way, 600m with some steep drops without any barriers.\nWe made it to the top in an hour and twenty minutes and were rewarded with a\ngreat view over Machu Picchu nestled in the surrounding mountains.\n\nIt was a steep descent back down the steps, but given the rush we were in to\nstart the mountain it's one of the few mountains I've finished less tired than\nwhen I went up.\n\nOriginally, we'd planned to stay al day in Machu Picche as we'd read that most\npeople leave in he early afternoon and there's better light in the evening.\nHowever, that was out of date information - now people who go up in the\nmorning have to leave by 1pm and another cohort of 1,000 people come up in the\nafternoon using a separate ticket. So we got our passports stamped and went\ndown along with Tom, Stu and Frank and had a quick lunch at the restaurant\nfrom the night before.\n\nWe said goodbye to everyone at the train station, then checked into another\n(cheaper) hotel. We were pretty tired and didn't feel like wandering around\nthe own, so for once used the TV in our room and indulged in a bad film\n(X-Men: The Last Stand). We met Eric for dinner at a craft beer place and\nhad a surprisingly good quinoa creme caramel (much better than it sounds).\n	2018-10-17 17:55:49.268034	2018-10-17 17:55:49.268034	2018-05-19 22:00:00	133
134	\N	Hotels and hostels in Machu Picchu town all seem to set their check out times\nat 9am. This still felt like a lie in after our string of early mornings.\n\nWe packed up, then had a disappointing breakfast in the centre of the town. <R>\nmine was good </R> We spent a bit of time in the main square, then wrote some\npostcards in a French boulangerie in between a few pastries (making up for\nbreakfast).\n\nWe picked up our luggage before heading to the train station where we met\nEric. We were in different carriages, however, so only saw him briefly. The\ntrain had some great views and even had a small snack part way through. Rosie\nremembered a strange show on the train, but (possibly luckily) we didn't get\none.\n\nThe train didn't go all the way to Cusco, so we got out and onto a huge bus,\ndespite the fact that there were only six of us. After a couple of hours we\ntransfered into a minibus, then were dropped off at our hostel (eventually -\nthere was some sort of festival and terrible traffic).\n\nWe met up with half of our group from the trek at Los Perros and had an\nexcellent meal, if somewhat slow to arrive. Most people were leaving the next\nday, so that meal was goodbye.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:50.141009	2018-10-17 17:55:50.141009	2018-05-20 16:40:00	134
135	\N	Today was a bit of a lazy day. We started with a few bits of organisation.\nRosie changed our flights to the US three days earlier to the 7th of June so\nthat we would be in San Diego while Bridget is also at home. This meant that\nwe only had three weeks left in South America, which suddenly feels very\nshort, even if we are ready to go back.\n\nWe also changed hotel, swapping good wifi for a warm shower - definitely worth\nit. We both phoned home over the course of the morning, so the wifi wasn't too\nbad. We had lunch at a nearby Mexican place which ended up being really good.\nWe also bumped into Frank and said goodbye as he was heading into the jungle\nfor a week.\n\nI wrote a few diary entries while Rosie edited some photos for most of the\nafternoon. We had dinner at a great restaurant, partly because it has a\ncooking class and we wanted to check it out. Also, the bartender came out and\nmade our pisco sours in front of us, letting us taste a couple of different\npiscos to decide which one we wanted. He then proceeded to make it with four\nshots of pisco, not that we could taste the alcohol in the drink. The alpaca\nsteak in mango sauce, recommended by our waitress, was fantastic and the\nmashed potato that came with it was perfect.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:50.666825	2018-10-17 17:55:50.666825	2018-05-20 17:00:00	135
136	\N	We both woke up a little sick this morning. I'd had a bit of a sniffle and a\nsore throat for a day or two, probably caught from Tom on the trek, but it\nwasn't anything serious.\n\nWe shared a really good breakfast at a bakery in the centre of the city. We\nwrote the rest of our postcards and feedback forms for our trek. We made our\nway to the Llama Path office to drop off our forms and our bags, then\ncontinued further out from the centre to book our bus out of Cusco for a few\ndays' time.\n\nWe walked back up the large, smoggy road to the centre, stopping in a market\nto browse souvenirs and ended up geting an alpaca blanket. On the way up the\nroad we had some decent street food - an avocado sandwich, a cinnamon roll\nand a soy-flavoured steak sandwich.\n\nOur activity for the day was a chocolate making class in a Choco Museo (really\nmore of a shop). It was just the two of us in the class and it was great fun.\nWe roasted, peeled and ground our own cacoa beans, then had several drinks\nmade from them: chocolate tea made from the cacoa skins and honey, Mayan hot\nchocolate from the bean paste mixed in hot water with chilli and honey, and\nearly European hot chocolate by mixing the bean paste with milk, cloves, sugar\nand cinnamon sticks. The last hot chocolate was surprisingly good.\n\nWe then tasted a range of chocolates: milk, dark and white. We then tasted\nfive separate chocolates each made from a different cacoa from a different\nregion. All were 70% apart from the one from Cusco, which was 85%. Rosie and I\npreferred different cacoas, but both agreed that the San Martin was the worst\n(apparently the only one that Peru exports).\n\nThe high point of the class was making our own chocolates. Our instructor,\nMartin, opened a drawer which contained two slow cookers - one full of melted\ndark chocolate and the other full of melted milk chocolate. We both opted for\ndark (because their dark chocolate is incredible) and selected a sheet of\nmoulds, then filled them with some flavourings (salt, nuts, chilli, quinoa)\nand topped them up with melted chocolate.\n\nWe left our chocolates to set in the shop, then went back to the hotel for a\nbit (more diary writing ... got a few days to catch up on). We collected our\nchocolate before dinner, then went to an Indian restaurant which wasn't quite\nas good as the reviews said it was. However, the free tortilla chips with\nchilli sauce and raita was a great appetiser (probably something to do with\nthe Mexican sister restaurant next door).\n\nWe took advantage of our hotel TV again that night and watched the second half\nof the Incredibles. It was in Spanish, but we know it well enough to wokr out\nwhat was being said.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:51.522797	2018-10-17 17:55:51.522797	2018-05-20 17:30:00	136
137	\N	We returned to the same place for breakfast, but today we each ordered\nsomething. The pancake I got was **huge**, so we didn't end up having lunch...\n\nThere was some sort of soldiers' day or graduation ceremony or some\ncombination of the two happening in the Plaza de Armas. We made our way\nthrough the crowds, ending up buying a couple of souvenirs.\n\nWe walked up one of the hills behind the city to the ruin of an Incan fort.\nIt's called Sacsayhuaman, or something like that - wikipedia lists eleven\nseparate spellings, all pronounced "sexy woman". The stonework is very\nimpressive, with some of the pieces of granite estimated to weigh between 120\nand 200 tonnes, sculpted to fit perfectly with the other stones.\n\nRosie had been here before and remembered that some of the stones near the\nfort could be used as a slide, so we got a few videos of that, too. We had a\nlook at the view and walked around the site, then slowly made our way down.\n\nAfter some diary and photos, we checked out a few different restaurants,\nending up at somewhere near where we'd been before with (shock) blended\npisco sours but really good chocolate lava cake.\n\nBack at the hotel, Peruvian TV hadn't improved but our wifi had so were able\nto watch a quick movie before sleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:52.357333	2018-10-17 17:55:52.357333	2018-05-20 22:10:00	137
138	\N	We went to a local bakery for breakfast his morning. I had a "lengua de\nsuegra" (mother in law's tongue), which is a long, thin pastry made from many\nthin layers with a central layer of dulce de leche. Honestly, it was a bit of\na sugar overload. In other bakeries I've seen since they tend to be a lot\nthinner.\n\nWe posted some postcards after breakfast, then Rosie had another cup of tea\n(the bakery hadn't had great tea). We spent the remainder of the morning\nexploring the Qorikancha - a Spanish church and monastery built on the ruins\nof the most important Incan religious building. Supposedly, at the height of\nthe Incan empire, the interior walls had been covered in plates of gold, only\nto be looted by the Spanish. The building itself is odd, a mix of the\ndistinctive Incan masonry, later Spanish stonework and Christian imagery.\n\nWe rested for a while on a bench outside as neither of us are quite over our\ncolds. We found some lunch not too far away - Peruvian sushi, which was\nsurprisingly good: rolls of rice, fried trout and avocado covered in some\ndelicious sauce.\n\nIn the afternoon we had booked a cooking course. It started with a tour of San\nPedro market for about 45 minutes, tasting three different types of\npassionfruit and two different chocolates. Our chef bought some ingredients\nand led our group of eight to his kitchen.\n\nThe group was hard work. The class made me extra thankful that we'd had a\nsuch a great group for our Salkantay trek. No one in our group today was\nparticularly enthusiastic (including us, but we're claiming sickness). Some\nmembers of the group seemed shocked at the sugar, butter and cream that were\nin the recipes, despite the fact they'd signed up to make pisco sours, quinoa\nrisotto and a creamy pudding ... <R> I had to be careful to not catch Daniel's\neye at this point or I would have definetly said something rude. I did start\nhumming Tim Minchin's The Fence under my breath though. </R>\n\nI felt sorry for the chef, but the food was good. We made pisco sours with a\nlocal passionfruit rather than lemon or lime and I think it did improve the\ndrink <R> Its better with lime. </R> We then made three ceviches - a traditional one, another flavoured with\na different passionfruit, and one with Japanese influence - soy & oyster\nsauces with sesame oil. All were decent, but Japanese one was a particularly\ngood blend of flavours. These were followed by two heavier courses: a potato\ncake (Andean potato and rehydrated dehydrated potato) in a huancaina sauce\n(a creamy yellow pepper sauce with some crackers blended into it), then an\neven creamier quinoa risotto. The dessert was a simple mix of whipped cream\nwith sweet cucumber (similar to cantaloupe melon) and chirimoya (a **very**\nsweet fruit).\n\nWe didn't need any dinner after that, but had some drinks at a restaurant on\nthe way home - another pisco sour and a traditional sweet corn drink, chicha\nmorada.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:53.14997	2018-10-17 17:55:53.14997	2018-05-23 21:20:00	138
139	\N	Our last full day in Cusco, but we were both in a bit of a funk. We had\nbreakfast at a different bakery from yesterday, this time with better tea. It\nhelped a bit, I think.\n\nWe got a collectivo (minibus) out of Cusco to Urubamba to see a few of the\nsights outside the city. Our plan had been to get off at a turnoff to the\nplaces we actually wanted to go, but the driver didn't stop. Instead, we drove\nsteeply down into a deep valley surrounded by snow-capped mountains. The\nvalley bottom was flat and completely covered by Urubamba, apart from a small\nriver.\n\nWe got out at the bus station and pretty much immediately found a taxi driver\nwilling drive us to Moray and Maras and wait for us to see each place. Half\nan hour and a lot of sharp corners later, we arrived at the salineras (salt\npits) of Maras. The salt pits are hundreds of large, shallow basins located\non terraces in a thin valley above Urubamba. There is a natural salty spring\nthere (I can confirm after tasting - the water is very salty) which can be\nchannelled into each of the pits. The water then evaporates over the next few\nweeks until just the salt remains. The top few layers can be used in cooking,\nwhile the lower layers are sold as bath salts. Overall, the valley itself is\na spectacular patchwork of white and brown as some pits are ready for harvest\nwhile others have just been harvested.\n\nAfter the salt pits we went to Moray - a series of terraces in concentric\ncircles. The current theory is that the terraces were used by the Incas to\nexperiment with new crop lines as there can be significant discrepancies in\ntemperature between the highest and lowest levels. We weren't completely\nsure if we believed that, but they were very impressive.\n\nWe tried to get another collectivo back to Cusco, but the driver we followed\ntook us to an SUV. We were a bit suspicious, but three other people got in\nsoon after us and the price was only one sol more than our bus to Urubamba.\nWe listened to The Way of Kings on the way back and luckily enough the driver\ndidn't even try and rob us.\n\nWe had a snack of a couple of churros (the large, dulce de leche filled\nversion) and listened to a bit more audiobook until it got cold enough to\nforce us out of the central square. We had a tapas dinner at the Museo de\nPisco (a restaurant, not a museum) and a few drinks. Rosie had a particularly\ngood pisco sour and was appalled at my pisco, baileys and condensed milk\ncocktail.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:54.152829	2018-10-17 17:55:54.152829	2018-05-23 21:50:00	139
140	\N	We left Cusco today, but didn't quite realise that our hotel's checkout time\nwas 9am ... they seemed us ok with actually checking out at 10am, though.\n\nWe had a small breakfast at a bakery we'd been before, then a quick tour of\nanother Choco Museo (I couldn't resist). The shot of hot chocolate was worth\nit.\n\nWe'd booked another cooking class for today, which turned out to be by a chef\nwho used to work at the previous class we'd gone to. We'd specifically asked\nfor a different menu so we didn't just make the same thing, so had a private\nclass. That was great - we skipped the normally standard market visit and had\nplenty of space in the kitchen (it would have been cramped with a group of\nmore than four).\n\nWe made another passionfruit pisco sours (that's ok, they're prety tasty) and\nlearnt that not only is Pisco named after a town in Peru, it's named after the\nceramic jars from Pisco that it is aged in, also called piscos.\n\nOur starter was another Japanese/Peruvian fusion called tiraditos. It's\nsimilar to ceviche in that it's white fish cooked in acid, but everything\nisn't mixed together. Instead, we laid thin slices of fish on a plate, then\ncovered it with a lime and coriander sauce, then added chunks of avocado,\nsweet potato puree and Andean algae. Rosie spent a long time ensuring all her\navocado chunks stood up in the same way - I suppose the photos will show if it\nwas worth the effort.\n\nOur main course was quinoa-crusted alpaca steaks on a bed of roasted potatoes\ncovered in a chimmichurri sauce. Similar to British and Irish cooking, but\nhard to replicate as alpaca isn't the easiest to get hold of. The potatoes\nwere also pretty different - one tasting similar to what I would call a\npotato, but with purple lines through it and another a vibrant yellow and much\ncloser in taste and texture to beetroot than potatoes.\n\nOur dessert was a (massive) quinoa creme brulee. The quinoa was mixed in and\nsank to the bottom, giving a range of textures, but I'm not sure if it really\nimproved the dish. We kind of cheated, too - the brulee wasn't blow-torched\nsugar, but instead a sheet of praline that had been crushed in a mortar and\npestle then sprinkled on top. The best bit of the dish was the salt in the\ncream - our chef, Chris, put in a surprisingly large pinch, but it really\nadded.\n\nThe class finished just after 1pm, earlier than expected and giving us some\nfree time that we didn't really know what to do with. Rosie got a cup of tea\n(it was still before 2pm, so it's ok apparently), then we sat in the main\nsquare for a while. From behind us we heard a real racket approaching until\na parade of some sort spilled into the square. It wasn't that big, maybe one\nhundred people, but it was still mayhem, maybe with a hint of organisation.\nThere were a couple of trumpeters playing some sort of tune, but way more\npeople with assorted instruments just making a din (not least the children\nwith airhorns). There were people dressed as circus performers doing some\nminor acrobatics and juggling and people in all sorts of costumes, including\na guy with an oversized cardboard TV camera pretending to film them all. There\nwasn't an obvious reason for it all, so it was pretty bizarre.\n\nWe watched the chaos for a while, then did a brief bit of souvenir shopping\n(you have to finish a trip like this with at least one ridiculous bit of at\nmost semi-useful tourist tat). We returned to our hotel to pick up our stuff\nand got a taxi to the bus station, only to get caught behind the parade. Our\ndriver said it was a protest about the price of living in Cusco, but if so,\nthat is a strange way of protesting.\n\nWe were very early for our bus, but at least there were places for us to\ncharge our devices. The bus itself was pretty comfortable, but was still a\nfourteen hour journey. Just like a long-haul flight, the seats all had little\nscreens in the back of them so we could watch Spanish-dubbed American films\nwith English subtitles. Rosie's screen stopped working, so we shared (there\nwere two headphone ports for each screen) and found the remake of Jumanji\nsurprisingly ok.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:54.770457	2018-10-17 17:55:54.770457	2018-05-26 19:10:00	140
141	\N	The vast majority of today was spent on buses. I'm currently pretty much over\nlong distance bus travel, but it's the easiest way to see quite a bit of South\nAmerica ...\n\nWe didn't sleep well on the bus from Cusco. At least it got to our\ndestination, Nazca, at the reasonable time of 8am. Predictably, we were\naccosted by droves of taxi drivers and tour operators when leaving the bus\nstation, but managed to extricate ourselves and find a nice litle cafe for\nbreakfast (where we were able to brush our teeth - luxury).\n\nAfter eating, we got a taxi to the airport to see the main (only?) thing\npeople come there to see - the Nazca lines. We booked a 35-40 minute flight,\nthen waited for about an hour, watching the overly-dramatic National\nGeographic documentary on the lines that must be on loop on the airport\nscreens. <R> The guy paused every 4 or 5 words which actually made it really\nhard to follow, but it did make it much more entertaining. </R>\nIt had been dusty earlier in the morning, preventing flights, but a\nfew minutes after we signed up the first planes were allowed to take off.\n\nThe flight was in a tiny plane with space for a pilot, co-pilot and six\npassengers. We spent a lot of the flight banking steeply to one side, then the\nother so that we could all get a look at the pictures (geoglyphs) below us.\nWe saw plenty, of which the oft-repeated monkey/mono and hummingbird/colibri\nwere the most impressive. We flew over the observation tower beside the\nhighway that gives a view of three of the (less impressive) pictures, but the\nflight was definitely the best way to see them. According to the documentary\nin the airport, the current theory is that they were open-air temples for the\nNazca people.\n\nThe combination of a long bus journey, not much sleep, lasting sickness and a\nbumpy flight meant that weren't feeling the best once we got back on the\nground, but it was worth it. Probably. It's one of the places I've wanted to\nsee for ages, so it was good to do, but was a long time on a bus. <R> Like a\nREALLY long time. </R>\n\nSpeaking of buses, after the flight we were taken back into town and promptly\ngot on the next bus to Lima, leaving in 25 minutes and lasting another eight\nhours. Joy.\n\nThe benefit of that bus was that we didn't have to stay in Nazca or get our\nsecond overnight bus in two days. Additionally, we got a decent dinner - pizza\nwhich hadn't been reheated in a bus microwave.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:55.478678	2018-10-17 17:55:55.478678	2018-05-27 19:30:00	141
142	\N	What's the best thing to do after spending 21 hours on bus? Another bus\njourney of course! I can assure you I wasn't this chipper this morning getting\nonto our eight hour bus from Lima to Huaraz. We were both thoroughly bored of\nour audibooks, the semi-functional screens playing films, games, and bus\ntravel in general. The scenery was occasionally of some help - towards the end\nwe had some stunning views of the white peaks in the Cordillera Blanca, but\nfor the most part we had either never-ending Lima or never-ending desert.\nJust a touch dull overall.\n\nWe arrived (late) and checked into our hotel, then headed out to another\npretty good pizza place. Normally, dessert portions are smaller than main\ncourses, but not there. The nutella pizza we ordered was probably the same\nsize as my pizza, but folded in half and served with a massive ball of ice\ncream. <R> This restaraunt was litteraly the saving grace of the day. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:56.092349	2018-10-17 17:55:56.092349	2018-05-26 19:40:00	142
143	\N	After long bus journeys we tend to sleep well, but not last night. Huaraz\nseems to be an incredibly loud place - dogs, car horns, and yet-to-be-explained\nexplosions somewhere between fireworks and cannon fire. Just to ensure that\nthe place never falls silent, some people up the road from us had taken it\nupon themselves to play a lot of music very loudly until at least 3.30am.\nAdmittedly, it may have been some kind of local celebration, but I have no\nidea. I mainly just noticed that it set off at least one car alarm which\nseemed to just be incorporated into the din.\n\nWe lay in until about 9.30am (it was blessedly quiet), then got up for\nprobably our last planning day of our trip. We booked a day toour for tomorrow\nand the four-day Santa Cruz trek starting the day after. Rosie booked the\nremainder of our accommodation and (hopefully) made sure that the sleeping bag\nshe'll get for our trek will be warm enough. We had a pretty big lunch at an\nIndian/Mexican/South East Asian fusion place, so have decided to skip dinner -\nwe'll see if that has any effect on our trek tomorrow ...\n	2018-10-17 17:55:56.825573	2018-10-17 17:55:56.825573	2018-05-26 19:50:00	143
144	\N	We'd booked a trek starting tomorrow, so what better way to prepare than\nanother hike? We decided on one of the most popular day trips from Huaraz -\nthe imaginatively-named laguna 69 (the 69th lake in Huascaran National Park,\napparently).\n\nThis did mean that we needed to get up at 4.40am - not really a problem given\nhow difficult it was to sleep there. The bus was supposed to arrive between 5\nand 5.20, but was late enough that we were on the point of going back to bed.\n\nWe caught a bit of rubbish bus sleep for the next two hours, then ate our\npacked breakfast at a restaurant in a small village. We saw a couple of\ndifferent lakes (numbers 67 and 68, I think) which were both a bright\nturquoise.\n\nOur bus stopped at the corner of a switchback in the road and we all piled out\nto start walking. After far too long couped up in buses during the last few\ndays we were ready for some exercise and quickly made it to almost the front\nof the group. The altitude probably helped as we were at around 4,000m and are\ndefinitely acclimatised by now, while lots of other people there probably\nhaven't been at altitude for long.\n\nThe path went from flat to steep to flat to steep. We made it up to the laguna\nwith plenty of time to spare, so there were less than ten other people when we\narrived. The lake is spectacularly blue, set just under a glacier that covers\nmultiple peaks. We could hear the sound of a waterfall on the other side of\nthe lake, coming down from the glacier.\n\nWe had some of our snacks (sweet and salty almond granola bars are\nsurprisingly good) while more and more people arrived. We slowly got colder,\nso after about an hour and a half (and loads of photos) we headed down. We had\na little bit of a wait at the botom for the rest of our bus to arrive, but not\nfor too long.\n\nBack in Huaraz, we changed hotel so that we could actually get some sleep. The\ndecent warm shower was a great bonus. We tried to return to the same\nrestaurant as the night before as it was close, quick and tasty, but it closes\non Sundays. We decided on another pizza place, but regretted it when we\nrealised just how slow and inefficient their system was. <R> It took them 50\nminutes to make like 8 pizzas. </R>\n\nBack in the hotel (later than we would like), we packed for our four-day trek\nand finally got some sleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:57.484599	2018-10-17 17:55:57.484599	2018-06-02 17:50:00	144
145	\N	Another early morning to get promptly picked up by a bus at 5.15am. We tried,\nnot particularly successfully, to get a bit more sleep, then found ourselves\nat the same village and restaurant as yesterday for breakfast.\n\nWe started to get to know our group: two American guys who worked as\nprogrammers, two American women, a British couple in the last month of a\n9-month trip, and a Polish guy in Peru for a month or two.\n\nWe had a long drive up a road with many, many switchbacks beside Peru's\nhighest mountain, Huascaran. We reached the highest point of our trek (4,767m)\nwhile in the car, then slowly made our way down into a valley.\n\nWe started our walk from a small village, with bits of gradual up and down. It\nwas a relatively easy four hours' walk, but slow. That was probably good, as\nsome of the others hadn't been at altitude for that long and one guy had had\nsome unpleasant altitude sickness symptoms. The scenery, however, was stunning\nas we are surrounded by jagged peaks, some of which are snow-capped.\n\nAt camp we had our obligatory tea and popcorn, then introduced the group to\nthe version of President that we played on or previous trek. Unfortunately,\none of the American guys went straight to his tent to sleep rather than eat\ndinner as he was sick.\n\nThere was a full moon that night, so torches weren't really needed. The\nglacier above us even seemed to glow as we got into our tent. <R> It was truely\nstunning. </R>\n\nThe tents themselves were decent - dome tents with entrances on two sides,\nplenty of space and a good porch. Most of all, they were warm and it was\n**cold** at 3,800m. The sleeping bags, too, were very warm - especially as\nthere wasn't much room to move inside them and a drawstring to pull the neck\nclosed tight. <R> The naglene bottle full of hot water also helped keep me warm. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:55:58.004699	2018-10-17 17:55:58.004699	2018-06-02 16:30:00	145
146	\N	Like on the Salkantay trek, we were woken up by a guide giving us coca tea.\nHowever, this was at 6am, practically a lie in. At least, it was for me - I\ndon't think anyone else slept particularly well.\n\nToday's walk wasn't that long, but did have almost 1,000m of ascent up to a\npass at 4,650m, the highest point we'd walk to. It was a slow walk as the two\nAmerican guys were both sick and had some altitude sickness symptoms. To make\nit worse for them, one of them sprained his ankle early on in the climb. <R> To\nmake it doublely worse for them, neither of them was a particularly strong walker\nand for at least one of them this was his first hike... ever. </R>\n\nWe made our way up to the pass, stopping frequently so we could regroup. Our\nguides had provided snack bags, which were very welcome: some chocolate, some\nsweets and a bit of fruit all in a drawstring bag, refilled every morning -\npossibly the best part of the trek, definitely the best bit organised by the\ncompany.\n\nEventually, the group split apart, so we got to the pass at different times.\nWe took some photos and had lunch (stuffed peppers carried by the guides), but\nsoon left as it began to snow/rain.\n\nThe campsite was only a couple of hours down the path, meaning we slept at\n4,200m, even colder than the night before. <R> I was so cold! </R>\nWe played President again, then a\nfew hands of beanie with a subset of the group - neither of the American guys\nappeared at dinner and the American women retired early as they were starting\nearlier the next day to finish the trek in three days.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:58.520161	2018-10-17 17:55:58.520161	2018-06-02 16:50:00	146
147	\N	Up again at six, our group split into three - the American women had left with\none guide already, the American guys went with one of the porters (and a\nhorse) straight to the next camp while the remaining five of us went with the\nlead guide up to a lake before going to the camp. We all really thought the\nlead guide should go with the two American guys, but he didn't seem to want\nto, nor did he seem particularly good at dealing with their problems ... <R>\nIt really wasn't very encouraging and I'm still not totally sure what the point\nof the guide was because the trail was totally obvious and he didn't seem to have\nany first aid training at all. </R>\n\nThe lake itself was spectacular, similar to laguna 69 but with a glacier\nactually entering it. Unlike laguna 69, there were only ten or so other people\nthere. Over the whole four days we probably saw fewer than 100 people overall.\nOn the way down from the lake we had a great view of several snow-capped\npeaks, including one that is apparently the mountain depicted in the Paramount\nPictures logo.\n\nMost of the rest of the walk was along a flat valley bottom that was almost a\ndesert in comparison to the mountainsides. Our guide said it used to be green\nand lush, but an avalanche had uprooted all the vegetation.\n\nWe got to the edge of a lake and our guide, Cesar, stopped us for lunch. Or\nrather, where lunch should have been. It was carried by the porter with the\nAmerican guys, but they were no longer there. He told us something had\nprobably gone wrong, so we had to walk to the camp. We all scoffed quite a lot\nof our snacks, loading up on sweets and chocolate to get us through two hours\nof walking.\n\nMaybe half an hour later, on the other side of the lake, we met the porter who\nstill had lunch. One of the guys had been riding the horse, so they'd gone\nfaster and were already on the way to camp. We all had some lunch (a delicious\ncausa) even though we'd had our fill of sweets, then headed to camp.\n\nOnce we finished for walking we played some more cards while we waited for\ndinner. Due to our overly-large lunch we weren't as reluctant to wait until\n7.30pm as we had been the day before. The promise of hot wine after dinner was\nalso welcome.\n\nThere were quite a few domestic animals about, so we went to sleep to the\nsounds of dogs barking, donkeys braying and the occasional moo. I still\nmanaged to sleep pretty well.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:59.114449	2018-10-17 17:55:59.114449	2018-06-02 17:10:00	147
148	\N	Our last day of trekking was pretty short. We got up at 6.30am and walked\ndownhill out of our valley for three and a half hours. The terrain was rocky\nand occasionally steep. Rosie had hurt her knee at the end of the walk\nyesterday, so was a bit slower than normal, while the American guys were\nobviously feeling better, so were faster. We followed a river down, with great\nviews as the river got wider and stronger.\n\nWe got a minibus back to Huaraz (three hours rather than the five it took to\nget to the start of the trek). The first half of the trip was down steep\nswitchbacks on a gravel road with a massive drop on one side.\n\nBack in Huaraz, we had a huge lunch at the house of the owner of the company,\nOrlando. We were then dropped off at our various hotels and said goodbye to\nthe others. The shower in our hotel was very, very welcome.\n\nWe had dinner with Michelle and Mike, the English couple from the trek, at the\nfirst Italian restaurant we'd been to in Huaraz. We were all pretty tired, so\nonce we got back to the hotel went immediately to sleep, happy that we didn't\nhave to get up until 9am.\n	2018-10-17 17:55:59.693511	2018-10-17 17:55:59.693511	2018-06-02 17:20:00	148
149	\N	Today wasn't particularly eventful - our last truly long distance bus of the\ntrip. We got up for 9am, then caught the 11am bus to Lima. We watched Justice\nLeague and the latest Thor movie on our little seat screens, then were pretty\nbored for the remainder of the eight hour journey.\n\nOnce in Lima, we got a taxi and experienced some of the worst traffic I have\never seen, not helped by getting stuck behind a traffic light that was red for\nfive minutes. Worse, we didn't make it through the first time it turned green.\n\nThe best bit of the day was our food at the end. It was a Friday night, so the\nfirst four restaurants we saw were pretty packed, so we ended up at the pizza\nplace we'd been to before. Afterwards we had dessert at the kroughnuts place\nbeside it. Kroughnuts are a mix between croissants and doughnuts which Rosie\nhas wanted to try for a long time. They were good, but not as good as a really\ngood doughnut. <R> It was international doughnut day and totally worth it. </R>\n	2018-10-17 17:56:00.076083	2018-10-17 17:56:00.076083	2018-06-02 17:30:00	149
150	\N	Our room in our hotel was right beside the always-locked outer door to the\npremises, which meant that until around 3am people would knock loudly to be\nlet in. Despite this, we managed some half-decent sleep.\n\nWe had breakfast in the hotel, then planned our short time in Lima (starting\nwith laundry ... last time for the trip!). We found a great looking, but\nsurprisingly empty restaurant that served brunch where I had a huge feijoada\n(a black bean stew) and Rosie had beef eggs Benedict.\n\nOne of the attractions near by was a park with a population of around 60 cats.\n\nI'm not sure how they ended up there originally, but there's now a charity\nthat looks after them. Rosie got some tea while I opted for picarones -\ntraditional doughnuts made from sweet potatoes. We then went back to the hotel\nto phone home and get the diary caught up after our trek.\n\nIn the evening we visited as many alpaca-wool clothes shops as we could find,\nlooking for a jumper with a very specific weave. Having almost given up hope,\nwe somehow managed to find what we were looking for in the second last shop\nwe knew of. We celebrated with a pisco sour each, our last in peru.\n\nWe returned to the same restaurant that we'd been to for brunh for dinner.\nThey had a nine course tasting menu with a mix of traditional food that we'd\nhad before and enjoyed (eg ceviche) among other dishes that we hadn't tasted.\nIt was a great way to finish Peru (this time, at least).\n	2018-10-17 17:56:00.620121	2018-10-17 17:56:00.620121	2018-06-11 17:30:00	150
151	\N	Unfortunately the proximity of our room to the road meant that we didn't get\nmuch sleep this time. We were up at 6.45am anyway to catch a bus for the\nairport and ended up jumping onto a little collectivo, which was really cheap\nand dropped us off across the road from the airport. We checked in, grabbed\nsome breakfast, made it through immigration, then got on our plane.\n\nWe'd been somewhat skeptical of our flight time - 10.32am seemed overly\nspecific. However, the plane did actually leave the gate at exactly 10.32am.\nThe flight was only a couple of hours, meaning that I missed the last 15\nminutes of the film I chose (LBJ). For some reason it was also one of the\nbumpiest flights we've had, particularly from side to side.\n\nIn Quito, we got a taxi straight to the bus station, then immediately caught\na bus to Mindo. We slept a bit on the bus and arrived in Mindo two hours\nlater.\n\nMindo is lower than Quito, only around 1,500m, and surrounded by cloud forest.\nIt's a small town and not that nice by itself, but with great scenery. We\ndropped off our bags at our hotel, then turned around and headed back towards\nthe town.\n\nI'd noticed that one of the main things in Mindo was a small-scale chocolate\nproducers. We joined one other guy on a tour of their place, seeing cacao\ngrowing, fermenting and drying, along with the machinery to turn it into\nchocolate. We tasted several of their chocolates and chocolate products,\nincluding a delicious brownie and "cacao honey" made from the white flesh\nthat surrounds the cacao beans in the pod. Rosie bought some of the honey and\nsome cacao tea while I got some heavily-recommended fudge (more chocolate than\nfudge, really).\n\nWe had dinner at a little organic cafe with a set menu which turned out to be\nhuge. To Rosie's delight, the young family next to us had a big, friendly dog\nwhich begged us both (unsuccessfully) for scraps. Afterwards, back at the\nhotel, the internet was actually good so we watched a few Sorted videos before\nsleep.\n	2018-10-17 17:56:01.248025	2018-10-17 17:56:01.248025	2018-06-11 18:00:00	151
153	\N	After another huge breakfast, we decided to go for a swim in the hotel pool.\nWe immediately changed our minds after touching the water - nowhere near warm\nenough. Instead, we took our time packing up then checked out and headed\nover to the chocolate cafe to pick up a few more souvenirs. We found a cafe\nwith some games to have lunch at and played cards until the bus to Quito\narrived.\n\nThe bus ride was fairly uneventful as we'd downloaded a couple of episodes of\nCastle for the journey. Unfortunately I managed to lose my only jumper either\non the bus or somewhere earlier today ...\n\nAfter a taxi ride we checked into our hotel in Quito, then headed out to find\ndinner. We ended up in quite a fancy place with interesting, but somewhat\ndisappointing, food. I had tongue, which wasn't as good as I remember it and\nRosie had a balsamic vinegar cocktail. The cocktail wasn't great, primarily\nbecause it was made from an infused local sugar cane alcohol which we tasted\nlater - both the base alcohol and the infusion were pretty unpleasant.\n	2018-10-17 17:56:02.796309	2018-10-17 17:56:02.796309	2018-06-22 11:40:00	153
154	\N	Unfortunately this morning Rosie wasn't feeling that great. We joined a\nwalking tour which happened to be with the same company and even same guide\nas Rosie had had four years ago. We learnt about some of Ecuadors's struggle\nfor independence and the recent collapse of its currency while also trying\nsmoothies made from pretty tasty local fruit. We walked between different\nchurches and saw some of the work going on to install a subway which will\ndefintely be useful - Quito is very busy and very long, including some suburbs\nit's 50km x 8km soo is hard to get from one side of the city to the other.\n\nWe ended up leaving the tour early because Rosie still wasn't feeling that\ngreat. We had a snack and some tea at a cafe, then a small lunch. We also\nchecked out a local chocolate shop which had won some international awards for\nhaving the best chocolate in the world (within some category). It did have\nvery good hot chocolate - rich but slightly bitter from the dark chocolate.\n\nToday was defintely food-focused as we also went out to quite a nice Spanish\nrestarant. It was pretty small and only had a few other people and the\nguy serving us had developed the menu so knew a lot about the food. We had\nseveral really great dishes, particularly the salmorejo - a rich, cold tomato\nsoup like gaspacho but with thinly cut ham on top of it.\n	2018-10-17 17:56:03.68185	2018-10-17 17:56:03.68185	2018-06-22 12:00:00	154
155	\N	This was our last day in South America. We packed up for the last time then\nleft our luggage in the hotel. We had breakfast in a bakery (melted chocolate\n**and** hot chocolate for breakfast - that's a good day), then caught a bus to\nthe middle of the world.\n\nOk, it ended up being two buses and by "middle of the world" I mean "Mitad del\nMundo" - a point on the equator close to Quito that's a bit of a tourist\nattraction. It turns out there are two lines there marked as the equator - one\ncalculated by an international group quite a long time ago and another a few\nhundred metres away calculated by GPS. There's a massive monument on the first\nline and a kind of outdoor museum at the second. Needless to say, we took\nplenty of photos at each.\n\nWe also went to a chocolate museum there, had a hot chocolate, had a local\nbeer and had lunch. We'd been wanting to try llapingachos and managed to find\nthem - a kind of fried potato cake. Before going to the museum, we tried to\nfind the equator with the GPS on Rosie's phone and found out that it doesn't\nhave a 0'0"0 - only 0'0"1N and 0'0"0S.\n\nThe GPS equatorial line museum was particularly fun. We had a guide who showed\nus several phenomena specific to the equator, although I'm not sure how many\nof them were completely true. The famous one is that water going down a plug\nspins anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern.\nOur guide said that's only true quite far away but was able to demonstrate it\nusing some trick. She also demonstrated that it was easier for her to push our\narms down despite our resistance on the equator than beside it, but I'm not\nsure how that works. We also tried to walk along the line with our eyes\nclosed, which is surprisingly difficult - it's noticeably harder to stay\nbalanced. Finally, we each balanced an egg on the head of a nail as the\nequator is apparently the easiest place in the world to do so. Rosie was,\nsadly, much faster than me, but her job has included the need to be steady\nhanded ...\n\nAfter another super-cheap hour long bus journey ($0.40 each) we were back in\nthe centre of Quito. We ended up going to a restaurant in the theatre -\nexpensive, but it was our last night. We had better llapingachos, plenty of\navocado and deep fried banana - a great way to round off Ecuador. Even better,\ndessert came with a shot of melted chocolate (twice in one day!). The\nrestaurant was pretty nice, particularly the free taxi to our hotel. I also\nenjoyed the pan pipe covers of pop songs.\n\nWe got a taxi to the airport, then checked in (with the kind of expected faff\naround me having an ESTA). The flight was a little late, meaning we didn't\nactually leave at one minute to midnight, but our time in South America\nspilled into the next day.\n	2018-10-17 17:56:04.567189	2018-10-17 17:56:04.567189	2018-06-22 12:40:00	155
156	\N	We landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida at about 5.30am with the thrilling\nprospect of a twelve hour layover. We found the bagel stall for breakfast\n(with a huge queue), then settled down in some seats. Rosie had downloaded\nquite a few episodes of Castle to tide us over. Throughout the day we moved\nseveral times to find working plugs and to stock up on food, but spent most\nof the time watching TV. Fairly uneventful, but it did pass the time.\n\nThe flight to San Diego was fine and we were picked up by Rosie's parents.\nWhile both of us will soon be traveling on, we consider this the end of our\ntrip. At this point, Rosie's here for another two weeks before heading to\nBoston (and Edinburgh for graduation, among other places), while I'm only\nhere for a week before spending a few days in Northern Ireland then returning\nto work in Edinburgh on Monday 25th of June.\n\nIt's been a fantastic trip, but I think we're both ready for a change. It's\ngood to be back in a familiar place. That being said, we both still have\nrepeated travel in the immediate future and neither of us have a flat yet, so\nwe'll be living out of rucksacks/suitcases for a while yet.\n	2018-10-17 17:56:05.43676	2018-10-17 17:56:05.43676	2018-06-22 12:50:00	156

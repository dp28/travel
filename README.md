# travel

This is essentially a blog of my time traveling in South East Asia and South
America. I've written it as a Ruby on Rails API with a React front end because:

- I wanted some practice programming while traveling
- I wanted to try using GraphQL in Ruby
- I wanted a few custom features for the blog so it wasn't just text and
  pictures

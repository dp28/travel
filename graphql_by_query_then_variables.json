I started in Edinburgh,\nfinishing moving out of my flat by shoving the last few things into my parents&#39;\ncar (with their help). We managed to squeeze into the jam-packed car to go and\nsay goodbye to my granny before heading to the airport.</p>\n\n<p>We arrived with over two hours to spare - plenty of time. I tried to check in my\nbag through the automated machines (human contact? Not for this software\ndeveloper), but it wasn&#39;t having any of it. I managed to check in at the manned\ndesk, but apparently could only get my boarding pass for my first of three\nflights (to Manchester). My bag, however, was given passage all the way to\nBangkok.</p>\n\n<p>The flight to Manchester was fine and I was told that I&#39;d be able to pick up my\nremaining boarding passes at the gate for my next flight. I passed a couple of\nhours programming in a restaurant (chosen because it had a few plug sockets) and\neating a surprisingly good lamb tagine.</p>\n\n<p>When my gate was announced, I packed up, found the gate, and asked the staff for\nmy boarding cards. They found them and were about to hand them over when one\nasked to see my ticket for my onwards journey from Thailand, apparently\nnecessary before being let into the country. Cue a look of <em>hopefully</em> mild\nconfusion while my stomach lurches - Rosie and I were planning to leave Thailand\nby bus which can only be booked in person in Chiang Mai. Damn.</p>\n\n<p>One of the members of staff recommended a website to book cheap bus tickets, but\nit only covered Cambodia. Improvising, I tried to look for flights from Chiang\nMai to Luang Prabang in Laos, near to the next stop on our itinerary. The\nairport wifi suddenly seemed so much slower as soon as I needed it to work.\nLuckily, Rosie phoned to check how the first leg of my journey was going and I\ntold her what had happened. Because both my internet connection and the queue to\nboard the plane was dwindling to nothing, Rosie found and booked both of us on a\nflight to Luang Prabang. Unfortunately, there weren&#39;t many left and we would\nhave to fly through Bangkok. Worse, the confirmation email was just a proof of\npurchase, not a booking. The booking email would be sent &quot;within the next four\nhours&quot;. Great.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, the airline officials accepted the proof of purchase email. I was\nthe last to get on the plane and my heart rate returned to normal. I sat back,\nrelaxed, watched some crappy superhero movie until the in-air entertainment\nsystem failed and I managed to get some sleep (thank you, travel pillow).</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"Rosie\"> Meanwhile in California I received a rather panicked phone call from Daniel\ninforming me that he needed to prove onward travel from Thailand or they wouldn&#39;t\nlet him on the plane! I quickly tried to book the flight that Dan had told me to\nfirst trying the airline website only to be told that was only one seat, well that\nwas no good, we needed two... I tried a booking site for the same flight and it went\nthrough or at least they sent us a confirmation email, Dan made it on the plane.</p>\n\n<p>Panic over, crisis averted... not so fast. I logged into the booking site in the car\non the way to LA and found that the tickets hadn&#39;t been issued there was in fact only\none seat, I was unimpressed. This now left me stuck I didn&#39;t have any proof of onwards\ntravel and besides we were going to be flying back into Thailand from Laos, would we\nneed to prove onward travel then, would one ticket do both jobs. I hoped so and booked\na flight from Thailand to Cambodia from Bangkok air, or at least I thought I did, the\ncredit card didn&#39;t go through. So I called them, they don&#39;t accept card payments over\nthe phone, I would need to fax them my credit card (what?!) I tried another booking site,\nalthough I will admit I was skeptical of them at this point, and this one worked. Or at\nleast I was issued both a ticket and they charged my card. I then proceeded to have a\nlovely lunch in LA followed by a visit to the very cool Getty art gallery and then\nan equally lovely dinner before heading to LAX.</p>\n\n<p>At LAX they didn&#39;t seem fussed about onward travel although they only issued my\nticket as far as China which I will admit concerned me. After standing in 4 very long queues\nI made it onto the plane, watched Goodbye Christopher Robin and fell asleep for\nmost of the remaining 10 hours.

The last-minute flight was never booked,\nthere weren&#39;t enough places, so it was canceled. Didn&#39;t they know that\nwhen we booked? Terrible user experience. Bad software design was quite possibly\nthe cause. But most importantly, it once again left me without a ticket out of\nThailand.</p>\n\n<p>Rosie to the rescue again! She booked a flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, a\nweek and a half later. That was a much better idea than my rushed earlier\nattempt.

The museum was primarily focused on trying to determine &quot;What\nis Thainess&quot;, highlighting the importance of the nation, religion and monarchy\nto its people. The exhibits in each of the 17 rooms were different in style,\nquite interactive and (mostly) in English. For me, the best and strangest room\nwas the one trying to determine how Thai certain outfits were by ranking them in\na pyramid formation. Some of these seemed clear after earlier parts of the\nmuseum, such as Rama being the most Thai and formal Thai costume being fairly\nhigh up. But what are &quot;Bike for Mom&quot; and &quot;Bike for Dad&quot; t-shirts and why are\nthey even higher?

We wandered around to\nchoose a few, settling on shredded duck rolls, deep-fried vegetable spring\nrolls and surprisingly good deep-fried noodles &amp; sweet chilli dip. We also got\ngot several things from a man frying small bundles of food wrapped in bacon and\nserved on cocktail sticks, mainly different types of mushrooms but also some\ntasty asparagus.</p>\n\n<p>We finished the day with a cocktail each in the rooftop bar of our hotel.\nApparently it was a pool party but everyone seemed to be ignoring both the pool\nand the blaring music.

The Grand Palace is a former residence of the Thai\nmonarchy and also houses the Emerald Buddha (which isn&#39;t made from emerald). The\npalace complex is huge and the buildings are incredibly ornate and covered in\ngold. For me, the most interesting (and least crowded) parts were Chakri\nMahaprasat - a Western-style building with a Thai roof - and a smaller museum of\nitems donated to the Buddha, which includes models of what the complex looked\nlike when it was built in 1782 and what it is like now.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> They seem to really\nreally like gold and they cover <strong>everything</strong> in it, you would need sunglasses\neven on a shady day,</span></p>\n\n<p>We then went to Wat Pho, a temple with a huge reclining Buddha, more intricate\ndecorations and a functioning primary school.

There were two of them, both very calm but also\nimpressive. We fed them sugar cane which allowed them to show their ingenuity - the male, Jimmy,\nstuffed a bit of sugar cane behind his tusk to maximise the amount he could get while storing some\nfor later. We then walked for about ten to twenty minutes to a river where we (mainly Rosie) gave\nthe elephants a mud bath, covering them in mud, then throwing water at them when they went into the\nriver.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> They were just such massive animals that it was hilarious to see Jimmy wander into the river\nand roll around like a dog</span></p>\n\n<p>We were pretty tired once we got back to Chiang Mai. We had thought about going to a temple out of\ntown that supposedly was a great viewpoint, but it was still very cloudy so we opted for a walk\naround the city walls. We ended up chilling beside a pond in a park with a couple of ice creams,\nfollowed up an hour later by a surprisingly large banana milkshake (served in a jug, not a glass).</p>\n\n<p>By chance, one of Rosie&#39;s friends from our halls in St Andrews, Tara, happened to have arrived in\nChiang Mai within the last day or two. We met up for dinner today with her and her boyfriend to\ncatch up. They&#39;d been traveling for the past two or three months in many of the countries we are\nabout to go to, so gave us plenty of tips. We had a great meal swapping stories, then headed back to\npack up, ready for our bus in the morning.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Thailand","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/06CL8j6qMavGAI57nARr41wKLeBnv8BiZ8pIm46o9-W4fEzbb7PA5-Y5157Oc19uINBSjTyTD7GpB_IFo-rFQawWQW6qV2PAcizTYhITIdXYZWO38ruYjzeKS1d-Bsvb1YyvjYpX510","width":512,"height":288,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"New friend","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5nWObh96OOHTb1I-7GMISUE0erJrZhSplu6dWyLNgdNNDUcpxK_BllRtUB00E1at7dly10JNGFTRRtVZ5at0ScTIulfXegeNUunLwIZTi-7YwFwlBXqkpeavwkAg5rniYDJzrTKJlQI","width":512,"height":384,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Feeding my new friend","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jj4w1h_BgWLvwYE0cFJOrf83rqsScjdhgyF1lnWgTWinLWYGRsl4IcaPB8LwXedDyuQSSo12daActQyUsdq4kwsIiZU2l87rX5MLFgrlJrFzGMDsTt8GJpQ5MG7ET0I7I2hVc9zfpsY","width":512,"height":384,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"This is Jimmy","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nj_tg-jRiiu_hRnIp8mexbR7ruO1tfwQH2rMvMzyEVTSIyF8slGmPR0EXPrMv7O0X_vClCFFiQYkdVP8qykBDuCxe0q631Gxg5-TjAvQhcN9xgBVbxKpfLniOr6GSlV4n--1pHUe1-A","width":384,"height":512,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"The banana shake in a jug","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":9,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Chiang Mai","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":11,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Chiang Mai","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>11, \"previous\"=>10, \"next\"=>12}":{"data":{"day":{"number":11,"date":"2018-01-14","post":{"content":"<p>I wasn&#39;t particularly looking forward to this morning.

We\nhad booked the Gibbon Experience - three days spent in the jungle trying to spot wild gibbons,\nsleeping in treehouses and ziplining between them. For quite a long time I&#39;ve had a semi-serious\nrunning joke that ziplines should be used in more places as a form of transport - I think they lend\nthemselves equally well to areas with tall buildings or large hills, plus they are far more\nenjoyable than other means of transport.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Just for anyone who doesn&#39;t know, when Daniel says\n&quot;semi-serious running joke&quot; he means that every time we are somewhere high he will mention that\nthis would be a great place for a zip-line. Every single time...</span></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;m getting a bit distracted. We dropped off our stuff at the main office, had a rushed\nbreakfast, watched a safety video, then crammed into a tiny songthaew with four other people. It\nturned out being packed together so tight probably made it easier to stay in the back without\ngetting bounced out. After an hour and a half on tarmac, we stopped, picked up a few dozen eggs and\na can of beer for those that wanted it, then drove through a river onto an incredibly bumpy dirt\ntrack for 40 minutes. The beers were gone fast - every bump of the road caused them to froth more\nand more out of the can.</p>\n\n<p>After having lunch in the village we stopped at, we trekked up through the jungle to a couple of\nhuts and some locals playing a game somewhere between volleyball and football. We collected our\nharnesses and the group of 20 was divided into treehouse groups. Rosie and I ended up with four\nothers heading for treehouse seven.</p>\n\n<p>In our smaller group, we made our way to our treehouse both by walking and by zipline. The wires\nwere rigged in such a way that they eliminated some parts of the path, with one zipline out and\nanother nearby for the journey back.</p>\n\n<p>The flights themselves were fantastic. Spectacular views of the jungle both near and far, hundreds\nof metres long and many over a hundred metres high. Each was slightly different in terms of speed\ntowards the end, so we had to hold our feet up to try and go faster or squeeze a bit of old tire\naround the wire above us to act as a brake. Sometimes I wouldn&#39;t quite make it to the end, so would\nhave to grab the wire and haul myself hand-over-hand to the end. After getting off, we had to hit\nthe wire three times in a row to send a signal to the other side, letting them know it was safe to\ngo.</p>\n\n<p>The final zipline was to our treehouse. It was 25 metres from the ground, or at least, to the bottom\nstorey (landing platform, toilet and shower). The middle storey was the largest, with space for four\ndouble mattresses &amp; mosquito nets, a large, low table, ten stools and a sink with running drinking\nwater. The top storey was about five metres up, a little crow&#39;s nest with a single mattress to sit\non.</p>\n\n<p>We revelled in the view. We had a spectacular view down the valley, surrounded completely by jungle.\nThe sun was setting just out of sight behind the trees as we took it in turns to have a shower -\nsurprisingly, the shower was the place with the best view in the treehouse. It was amazing, at least\nuntil plunging into the freezing shower water.</p>\n\n<p>Our dinner arrived by zipline - there was a small collection of huts nearby that served as our\nkitchen, with five or six people living there, including our two guides (at least for these two\nnights). It was delicious and plentiful, with four different dishes along with sticky rice and tiny\noranges to follow.</p>\n\n<p>We ended the night swapping magic tricks and card games with our guides, primarily &quot;magic&quot; Mike (or\n&quot;monkey&quot; Mike as he also told us to call him). We played spoons, which was great fun, but probably\nscared away any interesting animals.

At least, every time we walked past a tuk tuk\nor songthaew driver their standard question was simply &quot;Waterfall?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>We wandered up to one of the main places to find tuk tuks, haggling with a few. We knew it was\ncheaper to share the 27km journey with others, so we wanted to find drivers with other people heading\nthat way. After a few minutes, one guy said that he could find us one to share and brought us to his\nfriend&#39;s almost full Toyota Commuter (not as common as in Thailand, but still <em>everywhere</em>). This\nseems to be a common way of doing things in Laos - lots of drivers and stall owners seem to work\ntogether, sharing business so that the person who can most easily provide the goods or service does\nand presumably the group benefits.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I will say that this is the only thing about Laos that I could\nreally think of as communist, despite technically being a communist county its really hard to\nwork out what means in real terms for the people living here.

We walked up to the top, had a go on a swing only just above a pool at the top\n(and ended up with wet feet). After an ice cream lunch we had a bit of a swim in one of the\n&quot;refreshing&quot; pools below the main falls.</p>\n\n<p>Also contained within the waterfall park area was a &quot;Free the Bears&quot; moon bear rescue centre. Fairly\nlarge black bears, their bile is apparently highly prized for its restorative powers.

It\nwas hard to tell exactly what the intent of the sanctuary was - there didn&#39;t seem to be much said\nabout releasing the bears, but neither were they really being used as a tourist attraction, given\nthat entrance was free after paying to get in to the waterfall park.</p>\n\n<p>Back in Luang Prabang, we had the best meal of our trip so far.

So we sent off into the town of Trat; before tea, before breakfast and accompanied by my ever present sniffles. I was what you might call grumpy, if you were brave enough. After finding the post office I left Daniel in search of the supermarket that maps.me (great app)  informed me was right around the corner in an attempt to buy some tissues that didn&#39;t feel like sand paper. After wandering aimlessly through aisle filled with 97 different brands and varieties of washing powder (who needs that much choice) I found the single package of tissues and had to rush to pay for them before I sneezed again. I found Daniel back at the post office and wandered back to the hotel where I had breakfast and a cup of tea and thus felt like a new woman.</p>\n\n<p>The songathew picked us up at the hotel and took us to the port where we learned that among other fellow riders we would be sharing the boat with a live chicken. Which was fortunately confined to a box but occasionally left out a squawk of disapproval of such confinement. The first 50 minutes of the boat trip was relatively uneventful however the last 5 were wet, very wet. As we pulled into the harbour the heavens opened and as we got out, we and our stuff got very wet indeed. However by the time the songathew had dropped us off at our hotel it has stopped raining all together. I believe these downpours are reasonably common here but my goodness was it a lot of water!</p>\n\n<p>After a brief lunch where Dan ordered much better than me (annoying) we decided to go for a swim in the sea. We donned swim suits and Daniel then announced as much to his own surprise as mine that he didn&#39;t think he needed any sunscreen. This was in contrast to every day of the trip thus far where sunscreen has been liberally applied with a paint roller that he brought expressly for the purpose and which I am forbidden to touch (This is potentially a very slight exaggeration).</p>\n\n<p>The sea was lovely and warm and surprisingly salty (I know, I know, but you forget these things) however the shower afterward was fresh and surprisingly cold so maybe things are different here. After showers we sat on the beach for an hour or two reading (and programming) and trying to convince the puppies that live at this hotel to play with me, there are four and they are adorable!! After a time it became happy hour however upon approaching the bar we were informed that the man who made the cocktails was out fishing so we would have to wait. He came in later with one very small fish but he looked very proud of himself and thus my mojito was not missed in vain.  By the time he got back however it was time to search for dinner and so we headed off towards the major town to a restaurant called Table Tales.</p>\n\n<p>The food was great, and I got a mojito. We started with chicken satay and then I had scallops which were perfectly done and covered in garlic butter and Dan had a masaman curry which unfortunately was a little bit sweet, even for Dan (I know) but the roti that came with it was great. We headed back to the hotel, opting for roads this time rather than the jungle trails were had used to get to dinner. After admiring the moon over the water (and reading/programming) for an hour or so we headed to bed.\n</div></p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Thailand","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Thailand","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5xQrn0LyKik_SfMR5JnYPB8tKxS7eU6-0Udx9lE_RW3bFutRugdiMBPr-ZO5Wke6163mcPMdLv2l0bhEUY7z3ijjt08dKAX96kKb6extKlGhv-qQU7cGX3dPTJFEiFcuTD8AAHfZuro=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Sunset on a thai island","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y-UQDTFhZYrj6Y8dj0zx1I-Ejq_RSLIPAwNpExBc5j25PYRjl8rRG0ii1AF3sfygEyGdvizz1AimPSo1d88PSf2eUcVl6aubY9Hv0svVBheIhzuVtVGQ50D39GGyxjXO0wyk6vHl5XM=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"More swings","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/shKu1m6lKFdgYo3vz8Pkfvp8AyrS6ZxswYW0-ubVmWjVtqm3wJ8VowDuZL8Cxm20KvZ9Ny2oIdQjpKcUnuKKHr7KoFoBMcOuaZkdYKnu3ijRk9sbpyHia6boyG4UTI23fv-C0Du9jWM=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"Dinner!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":18,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Luang Prabang","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":20,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Koh Mak","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>20, \"previous\"=>19, \"next\"=>21}":{"data":{"day":{"number":20,"date":"2018-01-23","post":{"content":"<p>This was a pretty chilled, lazy day for a number of reasons.

We landed briefly on the first island, on a tiny beach with\nforest right up against it. The broken bits of coral there were incredibly intricate, but it didn&#39;t\nlook like the best place to snorkel.

At no point on either island\ndid anyone appear to demand 100 baht - I&#39;m not sure if there even were people on the first island.</p>\n\n<p>The beach on the second island was stunning - a small band of white sand squeezed between the forest\nto one side and cliffs on the other, with forest covering the steep hill behind the beach. Not far\nfrom the beach was a tiny cove cut into the cliff with just enough of a sand bar for a single tree.</p>\n\n<p>We went snorkeling between the beach and the cove and saw loads of life. In addition to the spiky\nblack sea urchins, there were plenty of small fish of a variety of colours and some larger, more\nimpressive ones - a delicate golden fish that we both initially mistook for a big leaf and a\nleopard-spotted fish (which I think was the same type as was caught by our host a few days before,\nrobbing Rosie of the chance for a mojito).

If you want to cross a road, you walk slowly but deliberately across, maintaining a\nconstant speed, but still checking that cars or motorbikes will stop.

You end up walking in the road, into the oncoming sea\nof motorbikes - many of the tuk-tuk-like vehicles here aren&#39;t actually a single piece, they&#39;re\njust a motorbikes with a detachable trailer.

The roof may\nor may not be waterproof and the walls do not meet the roof - making it somewhat less private than\nRosie would like while changing.

They&#39;re\nan endangered species of river dolphin found only in the Mekong, with only 80 to\n90 left. The largest group (about 20) are found near Kratie.</p>\n\n<p>Down here, the Mekong is pretty massive. It&#39;s about 2km wide and must be wider\nat times - apparently the water level rises by up to 15 metres during the rainy\nseason.</p>\n\n<p>We started at a restaurant near our guest house at 7am with six other tourists\nand two guides, then were driven 20km up river and got into our kayaks. They\nweren&#39;t sit on tops this time, which was lucky because (a) it was hard work for\nparts, so having something to push my knees against was good, and (b) getting in\nthe river was pretty rushed, so I didn&#39;t have time to sun cream my legs (my\nlower inner thighs are burnt, however).</p>\n\n<p>We paddled across the river, then down between lots of small sandy islands\ncovered in bushes, all of which must be submerged for months. We stopped on one\nof these to go for a swim (the current was good fun to play in) and have a\nsnack. The guides gave us bamboo sticky rice - sticky rice cooked with soya\nbeans, coconut milk and a little sugar inside young bamboo. You peel the bamboo\noff, leaving the rice covered in a bamboo paper that is edible.</p>\n\n<p>While on the island, one of our guides told us of many of the tensions\nsurrounding the dolphins and their history. He said that before Pol Pot there\nwere around 3,000 of them, but afterwards many people fished the river and had\nrelatively easy access to explosives and electrocution equipment. This made\nfishing easier, but killed dolphins, too. Now, there is foreign money invested\nto protect the dolphins, which works, but has its own set of problems. People\non the west of the river resent that the money is spent on the east, where the\ntourists go. People on the east are wary of corruption eats away some money\nthey would otherwise have access to.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we kayaked through a flooded forest. This was spectacular - large trees\ndotted sparsely through the river, sometimes close enough together to cause the\nwater around them to speed up. A large amount of their root systems were\nvisible, making the whole place seem overgrown.</p>\n\n<p>We emerged into a flat expanse with the occasional sand bank and struggled our\nway back to the eastern side against the wind. We got a sense for just how\nstrong the wind and currents were.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> ie. very strong!</span> We saw a few\nlocal boats with small groups of tourists on them, meaning we had arrived at the dolphin\npool. Apparently the dolphins prefer deep-water fish in that area of the Mekong, which\nis about 60m deep, rather than the rest, which is mainly 10-15m (at the moment).</p>\n\n<p>We spent a while paddling up stream, then floating down stream looking out for\ndolphins. We saw quite a few, particularly towards the end. We saw the same pod\nof four or five surface quite a few times, sometimes as close as about ten\nmetres.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The dolphins were amazing, it&#39;s a real privilege to be able to get\nthat close to that many of such an endangered population.

We&#39;d both heard horror stories from other travellers of incredibly itchy\nbed bug bites and how difficult they are to get rid of, so had looked them up to\nmake sure we could identify them. I squashed it and, sure enough, quite a bit of\nblood seeped out. Worse, we had a look and within a minute or two had found\nanother bug, which we caught as evidence.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Gross!</span></p>\n\n<p>It was after 10pm, we hadn&#39;t had the best sleep for the past few nights and\nreally wanted one good night&#39;s sleep before getting up early to see Angkor.\nNeedless to say, this really wasn&#39;t what we wanted to deal with. What could we\ndo? Try and change room? Change hotel at 10.30pm?</p>\n\n<p>The hotel had one other room free, so we packed up our stuff and moved downstairs. We\npiled our stuff on the floor away from walls or furniture and searched the beds\nfor signs of bed bugs. There were some marks and black specks that could have\nbeen signs of them, but we weren&#39;t sure. We decided to just go to sleep and hope\nfor the best, not that we had much choice. We also weren&#39;t completely sure that\nthe bugs were from this hotel - we both had found small bites on ourselves at\nthe previous hotel, but dismissed them because they weren&#39;t itchy. Not everyone\nreacts to bed bugs, so maybe we were both lucky enough not to and accidentally\nbrought them from the old hotel.</p>\n\n<p>After a not-so-restful night&#39;s sleep, we woke up without being bitten. We took\nadvantage of having moved room to one with a warm shower (luxury!), then checked\nwith reception. The room we&#39;d moved to was booked for the next few days, but\nthey gave us our money back for the other two nights we had planned to stay. We\nbooked ourselves into a new hotel across town, left our bags behind the hotel\ndesk and went out to explore Siem Reap.</p>\n\n<p>After breakfast and failing to find a bank, we spent part of the day in the\nnational museum learning more about the Khmer Empire, Hinduism and Buddhism.<span  class=\"Rosie\">\nI will readily admit that my knowledge of all three is lacking however the museum,\nwhile very informative only really added to my confusion. It doesn&#39;t help that there\nis a significant melding of Buddhism and Hinduism within the Khmer Empire but while\nI learned a lot from the museum I&#39;m still just so confused about both religions.</span> We\nreturned to our first hotel, picked up our rucksacks and walked a mile or so to\nour new hotel. The guy there was very friendly, but said that unfortunately the\nfree bikes that came with the hotel couldn&#39;t be used at night, so if we wanted\nto get to Angkor Wat for sunrise we&#39;d have to hire some elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>We had to head out anyway - we still had to get our laundry from our first\nhotel. It was pretty lucky we&#39;d decided to do laundry as soon as we arrived the\nday before as bed bugs apparently often stow away in your clothing, so having\nmost of our clothes out of the afflicted room was great. However, a few of our\nthings did remain in the room until we left - most notably Rosie&#39;s\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/travelingtufty/\">world-traveling squirrel puppet</a>.\nWe couldn&#39;t really both wash him and take him to Angkor Wat, so needed to find\na tumble drier - one of the sure-fire ways of killing stowaway bed bugs.<span  class=\"Rosie\">\nUnfortunately most laundrettes in Siem Reap air dry the clothes they wash, which\nis good but didn&#39;t really help us in this (admittedly niche) situation. Fortunately\nas we were trying to hire our tandem for the next day I saw that the place we\nwere hiring it from also had a laundry service with a tumble drier. After some confusion\nthe squirrel was officially bed bug free and much much warmer.</span></p>\n\n<p>With our tandem hired and the squirrel cleansed, we set off on the bike to pick up\nthe laundry. Until now, I&#39;ve found the crazy roads here to be strangely relaxing\n- you just walk at a steady pace across a busy road and assume everyone will\nstop or go around you. Of course you look to make sure you&#39;re safe, but otherwise\npretty much relax. It&#39;s not like that on a tandem, particularly when you haven&#39;t\nridden one in a few years. Starting a tandem is often a multi-step shaky process\nwhich doesn&#39;t lend itself well to stop-start traffic with lanes that are taken\nas guidelines at best rather than hard and fast rules. Add to that the fact that\nit was night and it was pretty clear pretty quickly that we were going to have\na totally new experience of Cambodian roads.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> This knowledge combined with the\nfact that we had just agreed to wake up at 4:30am to cycle all day in the Cambodian\nheat and I was pretty sure we were looking at the end of our relationship.</span></p>\n\n<p>After two miles of hair-raising cycling, we&#39;d picked up our laundry and dropped\nof our bike at our hotel. We headed out in search of dinner and ended up at a\nKhmer barbecue and soup place definitely aimed at locals. It was slightly\nbizarre, with blaring music and a Cambodian-dubbed Chinese film playing in the\nbackground. We were given a portable gas stove with a large dish on top filled\nwith soup. The centre of the dish was a hemisphere rising out of the soup with\nsmall slits to let the heat out like a grill. We were given veg to put in the\nsoup, fat and butter to put on the grill and meat covered in egg and sesame\nseeds to cook.

We got up at 4.30am, donned helmets and head torches,\npicked up our takeaway breakfast and got on our tandem. The aim was to get to\nAngkor Wat, a huge temple and city, for sunrise. First, we needed to cycle about\nten miles to the ticket office and the national park.</p>\n\n<p>The cycling was easier than the night before - much less traffic and we were\nmore accustomed to the bike.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Although not, as we were to learn the hard way,\naccustomed to the saddles.</span> We made reasonable time, primarily because we\ndidn&#39;t need to stop to navigate. Rosie, on the back, could check Maps.Me on her\nphone while I did all the steering.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I have to say Daniel is really very good\nat steering.</span> After a few bumpy roads we made it to the\nhuge moat around Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world (1.5km\nby 1.3km). It was the capital city of the Khmer Empire and has a huge temple\nat the centre and is stunning at sunrise.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, lots of other tourists also know this. We stayed for the\nspectacular sunrise,<span  class=\"Rosie\"> being jostled by enthusiastic asian tourists the whole\ntime,</span> then hopped back on our bike and continued to another\nruined city within the park, Angkor Thom, with another incredible temple at its\ncentre. Bayon is possibly more impressive than Angkor Wat, with a maze-like\ninterior and 37 towers all with a huge face carved onto each side. Better yet,\nas we had left so early, there weren&#39;t many other people there for most of the\ntime we were there.</p>\n\n<p>As the sun came up more and more tourists arrived. The park is huge and there\nare so many impressive, ruined temples, almost all mobbed by crowds of tourists\nof all varieties. We saw people with cameras on tripods with the umbrella-like\nattachments to modify the camera&#39;s flash. We saw plenty of tourists with money\nbelts on outside their clothing (how is that useful?) and plenty more dressed to\nthe nines for all the photos they were taking.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I was particularly impressed\nby the woman wearing stiletto heels and a bright pick mini skirt through a mostly\nbroken down temple and the people taking their wedding pictures there.</span> We\neven saw another couple on a bright pink tandem (theirs didn&#39;t have flowers on\nthe front, though<span  class=\"Rosie\"> they were totally jealous of the flowers</span>).</p>\n\n<p>The temples were incredible. We saw one which was essentially an island on a\npond on an island in a small lake on an island in a huge resevoir only a hand\ndeep, littered with half-dead trees. Several of the gigantic temple complexes\nhave been reclaimed by the jungle, surrounded by trees. Some massive trees are\nactually growing out of the walls, looking like they have been poured onto the\nstone.</p>\n\n<p>We spent the day cycling from temple to temple, ending up with sunset at a\ntemple on top of a small hill. We braved the traffic in a hectic cycle back into\nSiem Reap, dropped off the bike, had a quick dinner and fell into

We had took the opportunity to have a proper\nlie in (8.30am - four hours on the day before!). We had breakfast, then I spent\nquite a while writing up the last couple of days as we&#39;d been too busy and\nexhausted to write them up on the day.</p>\n\n<p>On the recommendation of our friendly and useful host, Han, we tried to go on a\nfree tour of a silk farm in the afternoon. Unfortunately, the bus was fully\nbooked, so we had a free tour of their other workshops at their Siem Reap\npremises. They had quite a few different workshops - woodwork, enamel, ceramics,\nsilver-coated bronze, and stonework among others. It was impressive to see,\nespecially after we were able to have a go at some of the stone carving. It was\npretty difficult to form any sort of regular pattern, but some of what they were\nproducing was incredibly intricate.</p>\n\n<p>As it was our last day, we spent a little while shopping for a few souvenirs.\nNeither of us are that into shopping, so that didn&#39;t last that long. We headed\nback to our hotel to do a little programming and have some dinner.

You don&#39;t need a visa for the first 15 days, unless\nyou&#39;ve been there before. To check people in, the airline officials had to\ntriple check all the stamps in their passports because apparently they&#39;ll be\nfired if they mistakenly let three people through.

We&#39;d\nplanned to got trekking in Sapa, a mountainous area in the north, but it&#39;s going\nto be wet and almost freezing there. Instead, we&#39;re going to go to Mai Chau,\nwhich should also have scenic rice paddies and be good for walking, but be a bit\nwarmer,<span  class=\"Rosie\">although still pretty cold.</span></p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we planned to have a day trip to Halong Bay, a picturesque area full\nof vertical limestone islands. Instead, we&#39;re going to go to Cat Ba island for\ntwo nights. It&#39;s nearby, has similar scenery, is less touristy and has some fun\nlooking activities.</p>\n\n<p>After our booking bonanza, we headed out into Hanoi. We&#39;re staying in the Old\nQuarter - a warren of small street packed full of scooters blaring their horns\nand driving faster than they were in the other countries we&#39;ve been in. Many of\nthe streets have a specialism where most of the shops sell a particular set of\ngoods, eg shoe street or sweets street. Barbecue chicken street is apparently\nvery popular. The streets have completely different names (and don&#39;t seem to\nhave signs), but you can quickly tell what everyone is selling.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things we&#39;d heard about Vietnam was that the food was great. Our\nfirst few forays into Vietnamese cuisine did not disappoint. Banh mi in\nparticular is delicious - a crusty Vietnamese baguette filled with a pork paté,\ngrilled (or better, slow cooked / roast) pork, pickle, mayo, some incredible\nsauce and maybe some chilli. We also had Vietnamese egg coffee in a waffle cone\n(although we got the chocolate version rather than coffee). Egg coffee isn&#39;t\nas weird as it sounds, it&#39;s beaten egg yolk and condensed milk, then mixed\nwith coffee (or in our case, drinking chocolate). It&#39;s creamy and sweet and\nright up my street. Apparently, it was invented during the (Vietnamese/American)\nwar when milk was expensive.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Its effectively a heavily beaten custard and was\nsweet and creamy enough to persuade Daniel to try coffee.</span></p>\n\n<p>I also had a less pleasant food experience - getting ripped off buying what\nturned out to be not very tasty donuts. A woman was selling sweet-looking\npastries and I was interested, so she quickly filled a bag, putting in as many\nas she could fit. I&#39;ll freely admit that haggling isn&#39;t my strong point,\nespecially when somewhat rushed by the other person and in a country I&#39;ve just\narrived in. I handed over the money, but knew almost immediately afterwards I\nshould have refused and only bought the amount I wanted and for a lower price.\nAh well, it was probably $4 - $5 more than it should have been, but it&#39;s a\nlesson learnt.</p>\n\n<p>We spent the afternoon at the Womens&#39; Museum and the Confucian Temple of\nLiterature. The Womens&#39; Museum was fascinating, giving us an insight into\nmodern Vietnamese life, tribal customs, religion, the war, the rise of communism\nand independence from France. The interviews with Hanoi street vendors made me\nfeel somewhat better about being ripped off and the effects of the war on\nVietnamese life was staggering, from the tunnels built to the fact that all\nradios had to be registered with the police.</p>\n\n<p>By far the best bit of the day was our evening food tour. Heavily recommended on\nTripAdvisor, we decided to book one rather than a cooking class as all the\nclasses sounded similar to the worse of the two we&#39;d already done.</p>\n\n<p>The food was fantastic and varied. We had pork meatball soup, dried beef salad,\nsteamed savoury pancakes, fried food in &quot;Vietnamese KFC without chicken&quot;,\nnoodles, more egg coffee and banh mi, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream.\nEverything was tasty and there was just enough - I wasn&#39;t hungry and wasn&#39;t\noverly full at the end. We probably ate quite a bit over the three hours.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I\nwas very full and to this day I don&#39;t understand where Daniel puts it all.</span></p>\n\n<p>Our guide, &quot;Potato&quot;, was enthusiastic and informative. We learnt what was in\neach dish, how they were eaten and when.

The main reason for coming to Cat Ba was to see the\nlimestone karst landscape, which we had ample opportunity to do. Cat Ba is near\nLan Ha bay, which is a maze of shear-cliffed islands, hidden lagoons and\nfloating villages. It&#39;s just south of the better-known Halong Bay, but\napparently the same landscape, less polluted and with fewer tourists.</p>\n\n<p>We had booked a tour with a highly-rated adventure tour company, Asia Outdoors,\nto go kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. After a short bus journey from\ntheir office, we piled into a large-ish boat (an old junk) along with about 15\nothers heading out kayaking and climbing. We chatted with a few people as\nclimbers were dropped off and had about an hour&#39;s journey to our kayak spot.</p>\n\n<p>We were in a group of five with two guides, almost everyone being from the UK or\nIreland. There was a father and son from England and an Irish guy who&#39;d just\nquit his job and was traveling before a career change. Our guides seemed like\nseasoned travelers, one of whom was aiming to teach sustainable adventure\ntourism in New Zealand, but struggling with visa regulations. It was a fun\ngroup as everyone was reasonably laid back.</p>\n\n<p>The scenery was stunning even if there was no sign of the sun and it was a tad\ncold. The tide was really low, so the eroded undersides of all the islands were\nexposed. Each island had an overhang several metres deep all the way around it\ncaused both by the sea and the huge numbers of large barnacles visible on the\nrock that would normally be underwater. Along the water&#39;s edge were all sorts\nof little caves and archways where the stone had eroded in odd patterns. These\nalso occurred on a large scale too - we kayaked under several arches and into\ntwo lagoons almost invisible from the outside. Once, we got out of the kayaks\ninto what could have been the mouth of a cave, except inside there was no\nceiling, just walls of rock at least 50 metres high on all sides.</p>\n\n<p>It was a brilliant morning. We took it slowly, following our guide and paddling\nbetween the islands. It&#39;s a disorientating landscape - without a guide we would\neasily have become lost. The rocks were sharp, the water often shallow and\nsome passages very narrow, so we had to try quite hard to have fine control over\nthe motion of the kayak to get in and out of lagoons.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Fortunately by this point\nDaniel and I are were experienced kayakers by this point, much to the relief of\nour guide who I think was concerned that we were going to have argument mid way\nround the bay. According to him kayaking is a make it or break it moment for most\ncouples.</span></p>\n\n<p>After kayaking, we returned to the boat, which then picked up all the climbers.\nWe also dropped off two staff members at &quot;party island&quot; which the staff were\nall disparaging about. It&#39;s a group of fairly plush huts and a bar on one of the\nislands, all built on a beach of imported sand. The owners have a deal with the\ntour company to provide some climbing instruction as an activity. The\ninstructors end up having to decide whether the people they&#39;re helping have had\ntoo much to drink to be allowed to climb.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It sounds horrendous.</span></p>\n\n<p>The boat crew prepared us a delicious lunch - similar fare to what we&#39;d had in\nMai Chau, but so much better. Rice, surprisingly good potatoes, battered fish\nand great spring rolls (deep-fried, of course). The boat crew were all locals\nand lived on the boat, shouting to each other in Vietnamese. The guides were all\nEuropean, Australian or American, as were the tourists, and the two groups\nseemed to coexist without really interacting except for lunch.</p>\n\n<p>After eating, we headed back out towards where we&#39;d kayaked to do some paddle\nboarding. As we were on our way, the clouds burned off and we got some great\nviews of the black and white cliffs against the emerald sea.</p>\n\n<p>We were paddle boarding with the Irish guy we&#39;d kayaked with and a couple from\nSeattle. Our guide was from Edinburgh but had been out here for seven months.\nPaddle boarding in the sun was excellent - it would have been worth coming here\njust for the morning&#39;s kayaking, but the paddle boarding was even better. We saw\nhundreds of underwater baskets used to farm oysters in the shallower water. The\nwater was so low the we both got our boards&#39; fins caught in the baskets at some\npoint, but it was so calm that we could easily rectify the problem. As well as\nenjoying the scenery we also collected some plastic waste that floated past us\nwhich Asia Outdoors would recycle.</p>\n\n<p>We paddled past plenty of floating homes and floating villages. These are little\nsheds on anchored platforms surrounded by fish farms and often with several dogs\nprowling along the walkways, ready to bark at strangers.

There didn&#39;t seem to be many\nbuses around, but Rosie asked an official who then called a bus company who said\nthey were running. After about 30 minutes we saw a bus and waved to hail it.

Pretty soon after ordering, a drunken English expat butted into our\nconversation. He was with a (sober) Irish expat, who was clearly embarrassed by\nhis friend and jumped into the conversation as damage control after a few\nboorish comments from the first guy. We had an odd meal, learning bits about\nexpat life in Vietnam from the Irish guy with occasional drunken additions from\nthe English guy, eg claiming he fought in the Vietnam war (which was immediately\nrefuted by the Irish guy).<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I did not like the English guy and decided fairly\nearly on that he didn&#39;t like me either (apparently because I said ya instead of yes).\nHe even told Daniel that he shouldn&#39;t date me, what a guy.</p>\n\n<p>Slightly bemused, we went back to our hotel to try and plan what to do in\nMalaysia, which is still a bit up in the air.

We learnt that apparently very few of the restaurants\non the main backpacker streets near where we&#39;re staying open before 8am, so\nended up with a pretty meagre breakfast.</p>\n\n<p>The day&#39;s activity was visiting the Cu Chi tunnels. These are a massive network\nof underground tunnels outside the city, up to 10 metres below the surface and\napparently there&#39;s over 120km of them. The Viet Cong hid in them during\nbombings, lived in parts of them and used them during attacks to surprise their\nenemies.</p>\n\n<p>The tunnels themselves are pretty claustrophobic - 1 metre high and less than\nthat in width, you can either crawl or just about walk stooped over and bending\nyour knees. These tunnels had also been increased in size to these dimensions\nfor tourists and had some lighting and ventilation added.

It&#39;s pretty tasteless boiled by itself, but we were given sugar and ground\npeanuts to dip it in, which I doubt is authentic. Tasty, though. We were shown\nthe chimneys for cookfires, deliberately designed to disperse the smoke to look\nlike mist rising from the jungle in the early morning to disguise it.</p>\n\n<p>We spent the afternoon wandering through the city, seeing the cathedral and\nstumbling upon another Tet celebration - a dragon dance on the street.

This could have ended up meaning the morning was a\nwrite-off, but instead we actually made use of it. It turned out that one of\nRosie&#39;s family friends was getting a boat built in Ho Chi Minh City, so we went\nto see it in the factory.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Thanks Bill.</span> We had to be there by 9am, so we\ngrabbed a couple of small banh mi from a street stall - bread rolls 30cm long\nand 3cm in diameter filled with paté.</p>\n\n<p>The factory was outside of the centre, so it was lucky it was still Tet -\napparently the traffic is normally terrible. We arrived outside a warehouse\nwhich clearly contained some boats and a guy ran up to us and started talking in\nVietnamese. Rosie asked repeatedly if he was Mike, the guy we were meeting, and\nhe said &quot;Yes&quot;, but then seemed to say that to anything we asked. He brought us\nto another guy and eventually into an office where we met Mike, a guy probably\nin his thirties or forties from Kent, with an Australian accent who had been\nliving here for the last four years. He showed us around several of the twenty\nor so catamarans in one of their warehouses at different stages in the\nproduction line. It was fascinating to see the two fibreglass halves of the\nboats - the moulds must be huge as the boats are over 40 feet long. We climbed\ninto a boat where the top had already been attached to the hull and into another\nwhere more of the amenities had been installed.</p>\n\n<p>We also learnt quite a bit from Mike about living in Vietnam and how it had\nchanged while he had been there. He recommended seeing the country by bike,\nwhich could easily be another trip. He also said that Ho Chi Minh City is\ngrowing rapidly but that quite a bit of this is due to corruption. Apparently\nit&#39;s legal to buy property in cash, so it&#39;s an easy way to clean money. He said\nthat government officials probably get paid between $20,000 and $40,000, but\nsome drive Mercedes costing around $500,000 (taking into account the 220% import\ntax).</p>\n\n<p>After our visit, we headed back to our guest house, checked out and found some\nlunch. We took another Grab car (South East Asian Uber) to the airport to get\nour plane (it was much easier to leave Vietnam than enter it). The flight was\nfine, but was fumigated at the end as part of Malaysian regulations.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> There\nwas also some pretty serious turbulence on the way in. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been\non a flight where multiple people screamed at the same time before.</span> We landed\non the island of Penang and took a bus to Georgetown. The buses are branded\n&quot;rapidPenang&quot;, but don&#39;t quite live up to their name.</p>\n\n<p>After checking in (and getting a tiny box room with close to paper walls), we\nheaded out for dinner. Both starving, we didn&#39;t spend too long looking and\nquickly settled down at a nearby Indian restaurant. As we were right beside\nlittle India, most of the restaurants were Indian. We had a fantastic meal for\nvery little money - great curries, naan, chapati and dosa (or &quot;tosai&quot; here).\nAll of the bread came with dips, so we were stuffed by the end.</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, we decided to catch a bus to a large Chinese temple recommended by\nthe guy working at our hotel. Because it was Chinese New Year, the entire\ncomplex had been covered with lanterns and lights similar to Christmas lights.\nIt&#39;s up on a hill, so was visible from quite a distance from our bus. The\ntraffic near it was so bad that we ended up getting out of the bus and walking.\nWe had a whistle-stop tour as it was 10.30pm and the buses stopped somewhere\nbetween 11 and 11.30pm. The temple was spectacular, but mobbed with people.\nAfterwards, we spent quite a while trying to get a bus back, especially as we\nweren&#39;t 100% sure which bus we needed. One going our way finally arrived and we\nmade it to sleep about 1am. It didn&#39;t feel quite as late as that because,\ndespite flying two hours primarily west, we&#39;ve actually gone forward one hour.\nDamn timezones.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Vietnam","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3hSRLuU0kyAKgE_2toiWAl0mt4Fk3HHJhTWTHg8CFgowPVbsXB9Hz0zNpAIrXY1wBSDejrRqaBl557-x7-wLydcutSKO4PnHFyotzEy96oskuhuLVvRAqlNO5pJHEQUqkeL0SLCLToQ=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Lanterns in the temples","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H9zFmLetjJN2xK7RijGsDTXeCG6opC18hCl55LjgykByEB9_J2wF0BVpYg_datC3ImADG9u2z3eUag2vwcYmGWY7Kq9NolIKrhKhAEhecalBIb5qpmyfqOyh1l1oTbHe9J0V6mEuMEY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"It looks like disneyland","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ciqGrV8z1joMgGbFXMhpvmHXMxvDmaDMBRh6p1cTQg6smjnmcuCn317rcmt8qIHjtfW6RfpTfYWW54Cd79hYZhfZRTDYoQDoeNurEV_3sesEe1-DLqlQwr4a_qOEwR9pqwXwFigPgCw=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Lanterns","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":46,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Ho Chi Minh City","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":48,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Penang","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>48, \"previous\"=>47, \"next\"=>49}":{"data":{"day":{"number":48,"date":"2018-02-20","post":{"content":"<p>Due to our late night, we ended up getting up pretty late (10.30am - 11am). We\nhad breakfast at a local bakery (cheese and banana sandwiches are popular here),\nthen did some trip admin jobs - post a few things, get some laundry done. By\nmidday it was <strong>hot</strong> - it&#39;s been 34 degrees elsewhere, but I swear it felt\nhotter here. We decided against walking up the hills nearby and instead spent\nthe day wandering through Georgetown to see the local street art, both murals\nand wire sculptures.</p>\n\n<p>Walking around the town showed us how different Malaysia is from the countries\nwe&#39;ve been to so far. For one thing, the roads are filled mainly with cars, not\nscooters, and you are supposed to cross at traffic lights, not just walk blindly\ninto the road. Surprisingly, I found myself missing Vietnamese roads - walking\ndirectly into the road just seems faster and easier.</p>\n\n<p>Another difference is the language - Vietnamese and Thai are tonal, so were\nvery difficult for me to pronounce. Even though Vietnamese used the Latin\nalphabet, it had plenty of additional symbols to indicate tones. Malay isn&#39;t\ntonal, uses the Latin alphabet, is pronounced the way it is written and has many\nfamiliar words, eg &quot;restoran&quot; is restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>A further difference is the money. So far, all the denominations have been\npretty huge, eg in Vietnam the smallest note is 1,000 dong and we&#39;d spend over\na million a day. Malaysian ringgit are only four to the dollar, so we&#39;re back\nto having ones and tens.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> There are even a couple of coins, although i think\nthe smallest denomination is 5 sent.</span></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, back to the day at hand, we followed another recommendation from our\nhotel and went to the snake temple for the evening. As part of Chinese New Year\nthey had a festival with some sore of fire display later on that night. The\ntemple itself does have live snakes living in it, some hanging on wire circles\non the columns inside (above head height), others in a walled garden outside.\nThe internet assured us that &quot;most of them have been defanged&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>We indulged at the various food stalls, trying a variety of (mainly deep fried)\nfoods, then sat to watch the main stage. At 7.30pm, people started giving\nspeeches, thanking everyone involved in the organisation. 45 minutes and four\nspeakers later, after everyone involved and all the attending politicians had\nbeen thanked sufficiently in Chinese and English, some performances started.\nThere were drummers, several singers and multiple groups of dancers. The most\nimpressive were a group with a very long, thin paper-like dragon suspended\nabove them on poles. They rotated the poles while walking, making the dragon\nappear to swirl through the air. At times they would have to jump over the\ndragon in a staggered line.</p>\n\n<p>After several hours, around 9pm, we decided waiting until midnight was going to\nbe too much. We had a bit more of a look around. We saw some more dragon\ndancers, this time in large dragon costumes covering two people each, pretending\nto fight on raised platforms and throwing oranges to the crowd. We saw several\ngymnasts, one specialising in balancing things on sticks held between his teeth,\neg catching basketballs thrown by the crowd on this stick, then holding a spoon\nin his mouth with a spatula spinning on it with a bowl spinning on the spatula.\nRidiculous, but impressive.</p>\n\n<p>As we left, it began to rain. By the time we found shelter, it was torrential.\nWe were glad to have left when we did, as in the few seconds it took to get into\nthe Grab car we ordered we were close to soaked.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> P.S.

At the tea plantation\nwe ordered some of their tea to drink (it had to be done) in part to make up for\nthe breakfast tea however I was sorely disappointed yet again. Instead of a pot\nwith tea leaves or even a tea bag we were served tea that had been made probably\n20 minutes ago and had been standing at just below boiling for the last 20\nminutes. As such it tasted slightly stale and overly bitter, it was most similar\nto the type of tea they serve at conferences where the plenary lecture over ran\nby 10 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>However, the view from the tea shop was fantastic and we even saw a hawk\nwheeling about above the fields of tea before it was mobbed by a crow (Chapter\n6 - Talons and Tea Leaves). The plan was to walk back to town first through the\ntea plantations and then up through the jungle paths. We set of and soon\nrealized that the Cameron Highlands are hilly, very hilly. As such the people\nhave terraced every spare acre not planted with tea (which does not need to be\nterraced) and planted an extreme variety of fruits and vegetables. We walked\nthrough fields of beans, peas, cabbages and some vines with a type of gourd\nlooking thing on them which neither of us recognized.</p>\n\n<p>When we were far enough away from the tea plantations so as not get told off,\nDaniel decided to get out his drone and see if he could get any good shots of\nthe terraces. We spent about 10 minutes playing around with the drone but\nunfortunately the wind was too strong, the hill too steep, and we were too\nuseless to be able to get any decent shots. We carried on up the hill as the\nterraces turned to jungle and the sky turned to cloud and then we were in the\ncloud and in the jungle. We continued upwards and forwards along what we were\n90% sure was the path although we had to do a fair amount of bush whacking and\nmany of these bushes whacked back. The path got very steep at points, to the\npoint that we had to give each other a boost up, but was always manageable and\nwe were very glad that it was not raining.</p>\n\n<p>Along the path we saw many pitcher plants which looked very cool as well as an\nenormous stag beetle the body of which was probably the same size as a salt\nshaker (like the type you would find in a canteen) but with legs and horns. We\ngot to the top of the hill (by going up, and up some more) and then headed back\ndown along a much better path towards the town. When we were about 30 minutes\nfrom the hotel the promised rain started and we barely had time to get\nwaterproofs on before the heavens really opened. The path turned into a small\nriver and we squelched our way down it getting to a tarmac road just as the rain\nstopped. Everything not covered by the coat was soaking by the time the rain\nstopped less than 15 minutes later.</p>\n\n<p>Despite now being very very wet we were also very very hungry and so went in\nsearch of lunch where I sampled some Malaysian Guinness, apparently it’s the\nbest Guinness in the world after Ireland. I thought it was good but a bit\nstrong. After lunch we headed back to the hotel to shower and try and dry our\nclothes. It&#39;s difficult to dry anything in a room that is only just big enough\nto hold two beds and two people especially when quite a lot of Daniel&#39;s stuff\nwas still wet from yesterday but we did our best. After showers Daniel worked\non the website a bit and then we went for dinner and tried to get a somewhat\nearly night.</span></p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k56N-H0YWtE4s0q-5-w7U8XRnAxFm1vfklguD6kV8ojd9m64tdjMiv17jUcNOJy2nwYa2L67KKPNCOq8jZOSaennyTrpQB4M1xwG-rwGcyYmcqFXkW1ghV2u7tCbEgPa-_yzipvtbDY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Nice tea set","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gWJcpsdnfMUpABeIdrI6FU9xWJt2cVCdnGxPLsnep3-lQUWZVWEkrK-UUq2DsDILEw71zajFGn-cIsILHCZ71qxNyKakX5TugB_Qz_DrMpm0W2UOYsb4iQHWe-d-CWUrtOZTrxXBPY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"The tea plantations","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ky33MKDcyjruE9dX35zx4BP9ykGQBb2HvDhscLCuXua2XNcIozKemYTglwbKNjL8ZQBP1yiPBiVV1bJOpXrBwn32DwHG0cclQoTLT4oDAHn2EBXZpPDeaoerDoiZKoNiXOdprOKmhW8=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"No view from the top but we were happy to get there","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JOp5f9sVSEm3TIcKo1tZRoUh5RHnDly233FYoD7CRZ2oxtVVYG7DlgK_8hmLYxdYabi6_iR2N5pJB8OjfItKybSmCeXnFDra8ipfAbgT4wiGs68PNyLIRbJvTn-zsRGY9r2ix8snF0I=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Beautiful butterflies","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lBYLmbEkOYlL2PoRl-MDP9EhmR0zyZLAbQxuf26HOEaXLrMO1wgoJM2lVJdSkMIkdMIjBCGT3IwnYHAMvlwEefapVJ6IS_mlPT1rNP9eurr2U9z1jsx_SpmkA1W0CUcraBwxeI1OEQw=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Rosie and the tea","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Epc2QKPm2LVM_bS9R5W8KZtjGymXB1Vri5D3mKoKnEAzkGal3L392rvlMstT8Bt4BCgkUmcpelm21TLe68Afahn7ofrp4NgdbD-Td3Bx4lO7OFJ-28q1ohfJi35ITP9WiTANulkGpYM=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Guinness!!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":50,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Penang","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":52,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Cameron Highlands","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>52, \"previous\"=>51, \"next\"=>53}":{"data":{"day":{"number":52,"date":"2018-02-24","post":{"content":"<p><div class=\"Rosie\"> Nothing had quite dried when we woke before the sun (5:50am) with the hope\nof seeing the sunrise over the tea plantations. As such I put on slightly wet\ntrousers and slightly wet shoes and packed a slightly wet coat into a slightly\nwet backpack. Our guide picked us up outside our</span> (slightly wet)<span  class=\"Rosie\">\nhotel and manged to strike a difficult balance of being enthusiastic about the\nmorning to come without being so chipper as to be annoying. I was impressed,\nit’s a hard balance to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>He drove us in a slightly beaten up Landrover (in British green no less) up a\nfairly bumpy to a view point where we waited in the steadily retreating darkness\nhoping that the clouds would lift and we would get to see the sun. According to\nAppu (the guide) it’s pretty much impossible to predict if you will see the\nsunrise or not but he showed us some pictures of it and it looked incredible.\nApparently, what you need is for it to rain hard for 15 minutes and then the\nclouds will lift and your lost sleep will not be in vain. Unfortunately for us\na light misting was all we got and the sun rose without ever showing itself\nbehind the clouds. As we returned to town we got to talking to Appu who told us\nthat he considered himself Indian despite being third generation Malaysian.\nApparently the three cultures (the Malay, the Chinese and the Indian\npopulations) are fairly segregated in everyday life having different traditions,\ndifferent languages and even different schools. I found this particularly\ninteresting given that even though I was born to British parents and have lived\nin the UK for 30% of my life I wouldn’t wholly consider myself British while\nthis man who has never lived in India, born to parents who have never lived in\nIndia considers himself Indian.</p>\n\n<p>Appu dropped us off a great place to get some breakfast after which we were\npicked up by another guide Kali who had a white Landrover this time. After being\non a couple of disappointing guided tours we once again had been reluctant to\nsign up for this one but you can’t get 340 5 stars reviews on TripAdvisor\nwithout being somewhat decent and Kali exceeded all expectations. He first took\nus to the</span> (Scottish-owned)<span  class=\"Rosie\"> BOH tea plantation where he explained the\nprocess of making the 4 different types of tea (Black, Chinese, Green, and\nWhite). The process goes as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Black, Chinese, and Green tea:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The top layer of leaves are picked, this used to be done by hand but is now done by a machine</li>\n<li>These leaves are dried for 48 hours which mainly removes the moisture on the outside of the leaves</li>\n<li>The leaves are then rolled to break up the leaves and remove the stalks and stems, again this used to be done by hand but is now done by a machine, the machine at this particular factory was made in Belfast which we found amusing</li>\n<li>The leaves are then left to oxidize on aluminium trays for different amounts of time\n\n<ul>\n<li>Black tea is left for 3 hours</li>\n<li>Chinese tea is left for 1 hour</li>\n<li>Green tea is not oxidized</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The leaves are then further dried and are sorted by size for packaging</li>\n<li>The smaller leaves go into tea bags and the larger leaves are used for loose leaf tea or pyramid tea bags.</li>\n<li>The leaves are put in big bags and left for a further 6 months before being packaged and sold</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>White tea is made the same way as green tea but is made only from the tips of\nthe plant and thus is picked by hand and is very expensive.</p>\n\n<p>After our factory tour, we were left alone so that we could taste the tea. Dan\nand I got one cup each of their specialty teas the Palas supreme and the Palas\nAfternoon blend. They were both pretty good although the afternoon blend was\nlighter and had less tannins in it, after the disappointment of yesterday’s tea\nplantation tea I was very happy with this.</p>\n\n<p>We then headed up to the mossy forest which is oldest highland rainforest in the\nworld. However first we had to sit in some traffic while two buses tried to pass\neach other on a road that two cars would only just fit on. It was interesting to\nsay the least. To get the mossy forest involved a fairly bumpy ride up some\nincredibly steep inclines and I was very glad that we were in a Landrover,\nespecially when the road disappeared completely or we had to pass someone and\nthus drive into the ditch on the side of the road. I was both impressed and\nslightly concerned for all the people who tried to do the same drive in their\nlittle protons and Hondas but we didn’t see anyone stuck so maybe it wasn’t\nas difficult as it looked.</p>\n\n<p>At the mossy forest Kali really showed his knowledge of plants showing us which\nwould kill you, which were endangered, and which would make you fall in love, at\nleast according to local legend. He also informed us that most of the moss in\nthe mossy forest was actually liverwort which is more closely related to\nseaweed. He also rather astutely pointed out that people would be less inclined\nto visit the liverwort forest.</p>\n\n<p>After the mossy forest we headed back down the crazy roads but missed out on the\nopportunity to visit the strawberry farms due to the traffic of the main roads.\nAs it was a Saturday the local market was in full force and had spilled out onto\nthe roadway forcing the traffic system to be one way and thus slowing the\ntraffic dramatically. After a pretty good lunch of Indian food, which seems to\nbe most of what’s on offer, we climbed into the long-distance bus to Kuala\nLumpur.</p>\n\n<p>The bus was totally uneventful although it was 30 minutes early in to KL which\nis almost unheard of in SEA. The buses as a general rule so far have been no\nearlier than 30 minutes late so we were quite surprised when this one pulled up\nat 7:00pm. After a quick but sweaty walk, we arrived at our hotel and were shown\nto yet another box-like hotel room. We dropped our stuff and went out to find\ndinner (yet more Indian food) and ended up with a Dosai bigger than my head.\nAfter dinner and a quick shower we settled in for an early night in anticipation\nof our 4:00am wake up tomorrow to catch a 7:30am flight to Borneo.</span></p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV5Gr0X6TBvo13UdeLej4eOkK3B-pIiXx_T1DfRW4bppgvFOQRBq3VZ7Lw1lATV9FdpMbehGL0y1uaROY888cEX4hrbKmh-6Dj_6hzFstwZV_nLdnj4VUGsC7bBiQFHvWgYNmEEeG7o=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"TEA!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wqJ2QeOLt8Awud6SjRv_Km2aXElj8pQh8Sjfgrg7xIX9vfnqINK0LZF27AdDF7I4hswSn6wfGZjYkaKE4XTUES599Jl-9cC0tO5uMtNzUTZUh-5kAyuUAt-kvcWlBOC46eBKdpRnx9M=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"In the tea plantations","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oNDEFf5pLB_lCA9JJZkTOG1IlkiGCRn2Q-JFl2AqouPOl91BeteScjDLb0nia6chlsRkPtEdI1S_0E9qIH3jQweMWfFMRAH3D8YQNwV3pUE0d8AYcOB4uQbkh6FE8ZxEtVvNwV3jfQQ=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Two?

Originally, we&#39;d planned to come to Semporna to scuba dive, but I&#39;ve had\na cold for the last week and a blocked nose prevents you equalising pressure\nwhen you dive. Instead we decided to snorkel at a similar place.</p>\n\n<p>The dive shop was heaving, full of activity. We got fins, masks and shorty\nwetsuits, then headed out to a boat with five other tourists. We were going to\nan island called Mabul about 45 minutes from Semporna. The boat journey was\nloud, but scenic. We saw just how much of the small towns in the area were built\non the water on stilts or jetties and how much rubbish there was in the sea.\nOver the course of the day, the boat had to stop and reverse three times to\nclear out plastic that had become entangled with the propellers.</p>\n\n<p>Once we got to the island, we had a brief stop for the divers to get more kit,\nthen headed to the south of the island. The water was incredibly clear, so we\ncould see that the island was surrounded by a large shelf of reef, sloping down\nfrom the beach gradually until reaching four to eight metres, then falling\naway rapidly. The boat stopped quite far out, but not that deep, maybe five or\nsix metres. Most of the others with us were diving, but one woman was\nsnorkeling with us. The three of us and our guide put on our fins and jumped in.</p>\n\n<p>It was fantastic. The water was fairly warm, the visibility was great (maybe\nthirty metres) and there was so much life. Fish everywhere, coral below us,\ndeep blue ocean to our left with the occasional shadowy forms of larger shoals\nor divers. There was a gentle current pulling us along the reef, so for the most\npart we just drifted along, looking at the multitude of fish and colours below\nus.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&#39;t only see fish. We&#39;d been hoping to see turtles and we weren&#39;t\ndisappointed. We saw somewhere between ten and twenty throughout the day, some\nof them massive. We even saw three together and saw another swim up for air. At\none point we also saw a sea snake, which I hadn&#39;t really been hoping for as\nthey&#39;re venom is potent enough to kill us all multiple times over. It didn&#39;t\nseem to fussed by us, though.</p>\n\n<p>The day passed quickly. We had three snorkeling sessions, each about 45 minutes\nto an hour. In between, we stopped on the island, where decent food was\nprovided. Many other westerners were staying there at the resort and we talked\nto a couple of Californians. There were plenty more of the local houses on\nstilts - a surprisingly large number, given that the island is so far from the\ncoast and so small, maybe about a twenty minute walk in circumference.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, like Semporna, there was a lot of litter. It was particularly\nnoticeable during our first swim as we spent a while trying to avoid plastic\nin the water. This decreased over the day, but seemed to be replaced by\njellyfish. They were small, about the size of a ping pong ball, and in the\nafternoon they were everywhere. Apparently they weren&#39;t dangerous, but they\ncould definitely sting. We both ended the day with the feeling of pinpricks\non the exposed parts of our bodies and gratefully accepted some vinegar to rub\ninto them.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I apparently react to their stings much more than Daniel and even\nnow have lots of little red dots all over my forearms and legs.

They&#39;re next door to each other, 45 minutes by\nminibus from Sandakan.\nWe got the earliest bus (9am, meaning we got to sleep in until just before\n8am!), arriving in time for the 10am orangutan feeding. The centre is situated\nin 43 square kilometres of protected rainforest and rehabilitates orphaned and\nrescued orangutans, slowly weaning them off the need for human-provided help\nand food. Visitors, like us, can see orangutans that decide to come to the\nmorning and afternoon feedings, but it&#39;s not guaranteed. The food is\ndeliberately boring to encourage them to forage for themselves.\nWe went to both the morning and afternoon feedings. We weren&#39;t lucky in the\nafternoon, probably because it was still slightly raining after an hour of\nvery heavy rain. As we saw in the informational video, orangutans don&#39;t really\nlike the rain, despite living where they do.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The video showed a really\nhilarious clip of a young orangutan having a massive tanrum because it was\nraining, poor little orangutan.</span>\nIn the morning, however, we were lucky. Four orangutans arrived to get some\nfood, swinging through the trees and on the ropes to the platform. They spent\n15 - 20 minutes eating and swinging, several of them grabbing food and\nswinging away along ropes, only to accidently drop their chosen bananas.\nAfter the feeding, we went to the outdoor nursery where slightly younger\napes were playing on climbing frames. There&#39;s an indoor nursery (where\ntourists aren&#39;t allowed) for younger ones, where they probably have a lot more\nhuman contact. In the outdoor nursery, they&#39;re weaned off human contact and\npaired up with an older orangutan to learn skills they would have learnt from\ntheir mother. While we were there, two slightly different sized orangutans\nspent most of the time having scrappy fights, so it looks like the buddy\nsystem is kind of like having a sibling (I&#39;m sure all brothers fight like\nthat).\nBetween the feedings, we headed over to the sun bear centre. Sun bears are the\nsmallest bears, only growing to 1.5m (just bigger than an adult male\norangutan). Like orangutans, they&#39;re endangered, often kept as pets and take a\nlong time to rehabilitate. They also climb a lot - while we were there, one\nspent at least an hour sitting in the same tree rooting around for food.<span  class=\"Rosie\">\nSun bears are my new favorite bears, they are just slightly dopey but very\nadorable for it.</span>\nWhile in the sun bear centre, an orangutan made its way onto the board walk we\nwere on. There were people on all the walks leading to it, so it just sat in\nplace for a few minutes, then slowly made its way toward us. One of the\nmembers of staff got everyone near by to move back and out of the way while\nthe orangutan slowly made its way down the board walk and around the corner.\nIt kind of felt like someone was coming down the road with a police escort\nmoving the public out of the way - the orangutan almost seemed oblivious to\nus.\nOur other run in with an orangutan was back at the visitors&#39; centre of the\nrehabilitation centre in the afternoon. It had been raining hard for a long\ntime when a slightly wet orangutan came around the corner of the next building\nand swung across the shelter between that building and ours. We moved back to\ngive it space until it left over the roof. A member of staff said he&#39;d seen it\nearlier in a tree nearby tring to make a nest, but had probably given up and\ncome looking for better shelter.\nAfter a great day seeing fascinating creatures in their natural habitats, we\nheaded back to Sandakan. We had a reasonable dinner at a rooftop restaurant,\nthen I caught up with this diary (it&#39;s so easy to fall behind - it took me\naround an hour just to do today and yesterday).</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DytIgwnpTWSWBjBRJu4fXCu8V_atvZuuxiA0_MMXdjjdGiM0vrFM9BG56zs19zTJ98zSjnePBW3aEGC13Te6-bKq3vMRPu2F-AM1c7A_rzpjD1QVx84vGF6-_b0JAYRbut8NhzaVDtU=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Daniel found a friend","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wazFsWUaMTXeufSPEjd2lWsqIfNGX4o4Cy18prytuy2L125Lz3kro2pCCTALlJPP61CLDAKXqDjnNDy0SGekR7T0iuEdIKw1d1Q4DTTD5XJDb8QGK_I9fAfieop9-AvkapHnvASriqU=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Is this a good look","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_7MLpbSCucd6Ns2I7brPbPYKbMQGxaS3QUWdcCGhtQqpBD9b86fLZeZ8yxD9F5y6h_b-jfJyKTKNrh4Ne2mTl4y8AMNcj3-p5C1RrYDAJedaZQfCB8zuaLP7dcWuRGWu6F4egXcfhrs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Orangutan!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ISFRwIkUxXkT_EqefpYS1zWVkIcvV1EOMJXvoCYujVAkJn7cm9NLPExfkOc7ZZiDmt8UF14mLaF4OdWTJDvdLxZB_CQls53nSerQkAtUMCQEY4ZJetzUsWxi73MGKdRWQ1crIVu3YjA=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Apparently brothers from every species fight","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2xNRRUSc7BUC2gFQywAU62Azs_B1nXTb9RCiCIt2zoM7xjjqo2ueTHDJ_J80qZXuN5J7vJFEmG8ViiBHixW-WSrgG4rDBZD-LWXa45XbXsOt-43qGEoWjzcJCRLWw0h9PYQm1xzQYcs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Little derp","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tHTkuCW8Pe70FNnuEo-ha4xRHcGr4EgP-JUNGoFJkSStr-vYHsRADok5ES5Hy5vpgd57ZLCjwM6Zh6FH6DBXvMblHty_ybuquET-X115zXGFQuWbgQ8MHWJFKip-CPbEmcHE7UasyIY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Hey guys, do you think my feet smell?

However, with a bit more research it proved more tedious and\nunpredictable to get there than it was worth for a day or two. Instead, we\noptend to go to Taman Negara (Malay for &quot;National Park&quot;), the oldest\nrainforest in the world (130 million years).</p>\n\n<p>You can get there either by two buses or a bus and a boat. We went for the bus\nand boat, which left from just around the corner from our hostel in KL. The\nbus dropped us off at a jetty where we could get lunch and buy permits for the\npark. The permits cost $0.25, but the fine for not having one is $2,500.</p>\n\n<p>The boat ride lasted about an hour and a half in a long, thin motor boat with\nabout ten of us sat in pairs facing forward. We were sitting at water level\nand the sides of the boat didn&#39;t extend that high, so we got sprayed quite a\nbit on the way up river.</p>\n\n<p>The small village, Kuala Tahan, seems to be the main base people use to\nexplore the park. It&#39;s tiny, but filled with guest houses and floating\nrestaurants (pretty low down at the moment because the water is so low). We\nspent ten or twenty minutes following different sets of instructions to get\nto our guest house - it had two names, was shown to be across the river on\nMaps.Me, and was on the other side of the village from where we were initially\npointed. Our room was nice enough - it had a balcony and a fan, but a squat\ntoilet and was pretty much an oven.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The fact that we spent 20 minutes\ntrying to find our guest house is really impressive when you consider that the\nentire town takes about 20 minutes to walk across. Also it was 34 degrees and\nsuper humid, we were very sweaty when we found the guest house, a theme that\ncontinued through out our time in Teman Negara.</span></p>\n\n<p>The park itself was across the river - a one ringgit ($0.25/£0.20), one minute\nboat trip away. There was a large upmarket resort on that side, apparently\nrecently renovated due to the river flooding (despite being about 10 metres\nabove the current water level). We walked through the resort to a nature hide\nnearby and spotted a wild pig before returning for dinner. The pig was\ndefinitely wild as the town is definitely Muslim, so no pork on any menu. We\nalso saw several lizards - one only a couple of centimetres long, another\nclose to a metre.</p>\n\n<p>Having spent most of the day sitting, we decided to go on an organised night\nwalk in the park. At the start of the walk it looked like we&#39;d made a mistake\n- we were with a fairly loud family and the walk was just along the 600m\nboardwalk to the hide we&#39;d been to earlier. However, it was great - we saw and\nlearnt a lot even over that difference, and, as the family was French, I got\nto brush up on my French listening skills (or lack there of). Our guide was\ngreat and had several tricks for seeing insects. The best was that with a\ntorch on your head you can see the reflections from spiders&#39; eyes very easily.\nThey look like little sparkles and can be harder to spot after it has rained\nas they also look like reflections from water droplets. Another trick was\nusing a UV torch to search for scorpions. They&#39;re black, but have phosphorus\nin their shell, so appear bright green in UV.</p>\n\n<p>We ended up seeing loads of insects - in addition to spiders and scorpions, we\nsaw huge millipedes, worker &amp; soldier termites, stick insects, a single\nglowworm and a single firefly. At the hide, we saw a deer and on the way back\nwe saw a porcupine under one of the buildings of the resort. On our way back\nto the guest house we saw (and heard) many large beetles, which can make an\nincredible racket<span  class=\"Rosie\"> all night</span>.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yPk8M5CbWUc3Mc5_YyDbzWzQtrIGmSiV15I9assoezarlm-leNk1kbNoRzJPmc-SG1b2C72iMeRyyzKb8-7tWnAHjzEfCPenFwX_Zpj1IMNmqON_b3svyUor5io2IHmbJv36H6yE5UE=w2400","width":2400,"height":1803,"aspectRatio":1.3311148086522462,"caption":"On the boat","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HhsrKDb_N1eWKCuLo_WVIkp2_K4DzVxMwQ9uXZTcaSOms56kaYHl9svDovC84IEIt2zZn5XKN652AhmeXS6oFWPgeTApPiKUItBZ2ETFYo1OozKmvQRZWCsA361lSHKwE8IJiWO7xas=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Giant millipede!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7QKcDEhUJRw5xlispm8wTZpwSjWtXAOG_X0_OnuecO6ukJQJb0l9W5YaEGBZQHyPjOdJCkhaZ6qJslFVYErjwTZj4WuldZf2lrFBew4WE2E6JoQncMNfeEmLKXpsAw8ic38tFcBvn0c=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Lichen Spider","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EEeFj6vls-jZtUABrgMzrhFOAquv10VlJ7dYEfoCzLIkYRssKxAVC3ond5pb3jO4EGvJhkOPgGvnNTQHaXHZAMkOIYPGmh3bkbplKJMTnC-RVrsSd_kjB0cFm_aBAaHF0XOeTz9fE2Q=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Two stick insects together","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":60,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Kuala Lumpur","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":62,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Taman Negara","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>62, \"previous\"=>61, \"next\"=>63}":{"data":{"day":{"number":62,"date":"2018-03-06","post":{"content":"<p>The plan for the day was a long walk around a circuit in the forst with a stop\noff at a hide.

We knew we\nwere going a bit slower than normal, but 2km per hour seemed very slow. The\ndistance also didn&#39;t match up with Maps.Me, or even the other signs - it said\nit was 5km back to the village, so something was up. We continued anyway.</p>\n\n<p>We passed a couple with a guide (with a huge rucksack) heading to the same\nhide, but with the intention of sleeping there. The guide seemed surprised we\nwere going for a day trip, and more so that we weren&#39;t coming back the same\nway.</p>\n\n<p>We walked on, seeing huge buttress-rooted trees, insects, small streams,\nfallen trees and the leavings of some large animal (elephants?). By half past\none, we were sweaty, hungry, tired and still 2.5km from the hide by Maps.Me&#39;s\nbuest guess (our more reliable distance info source). We decided to turn\naround, find somewhere to have lunch, then head back to town.</p>\n\n<p>Our walk back was, unsurprisingly, pretty similar to the way out.

Towards the end of our walk, we happened upon a pair\nof wild pigs, just off to the side of the path.</p>\n\n<p>Tired but happy, we finished at the resort. We treated ourselves to some more\nexpensive drinks (banana shake for me, a guinness and a 100 plus for Rosie),\nand enjoyed not walking for a while. After our rest, we headed back to the\nguest house for a much-needed shower.</p>\n\n<p>In the evening, we booked onto a night safari with the same tour operator as\nthe day before, Han Travel. Along with two other couples, we got in the back\nof a 4x4 pickup truck which spent an hour driving through a palm plantation\nbeside the rainforest. A guy on the roof of the truck used a strong torch to\nsearch for animals and direct the driver. We spotted two small cat (probably\nleopard cats), a couple of owls, and, on the road back, several wild pigs. For\nme, it was worth it just to see the difference between plantation and forest.\nThe plantation had presumably been harvested or created recently - there were\nonly some small palms around, mostly just churned earth and clay.

We used the rest of the morning by going for a few small walks along the board walks by the resort. At the start of the first one we heard a slithering in the dried leaves and saw a thin black snake make its way away from the path.\nIn the afternoon we went on a &quot;rapid shooting&quot; tour, which basically meant getting in one of the long, thin boats we&#39;d arrived in and going straight through the rapids up river, getting thoroughly soaked in the process. At the first set of rapids, however, the propellor hit a rock and the engine stopped. The boat floated downstream and the driver and the guy at the front of the boat both jumped out and swam the boat closer to shore. The guy at the front held it where he could stand while the other guy fixed the problem. It started to rain, but after five minutes or so we were off and successfully navigated the rapids.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Daniel is down playing this. There was a really loud clunk and then the motor stoped and we started floating backwards down river at really quite an impressive speed. The guide at the front then splashed out and kicked us into a backwater while the guy at the back started pounding on the motor, presumably fixing the propellor.</span>\nBy this point, the rain was at full force. Even if we hadn&#39;t had waves occasionally soaking us, we would have been drenched in minutes. As we&#39;d expected to get wet, it was pretty enjoyable.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It was great, I love it when it rains and you were already planning on getting wet.</span>\nThe boat stopped beside a small village so that the other tourists with us could go and se the Orang Asli (aboriginal people). We&#39;d opted not to as we hadn&#39;t enjoyed similar things in the past, we know the money doesn&#39;t really go to them and that, if not for tourist money, they&#39;re traditionally nomadic. Instead, we swam in the river which was noticeably warmer than the rain. Unfortunately, that seems to have killed my watch, despite claiming to be water resistant to 100m and dealing with worse submersion before. Damn.\nBack in Kuala Tahan, we showered, dried and I caught up on this diary (a bit). After dinner, we went for our own night walk. We weren&#39;t quite as good as our guide, but saw plenty of spiders, a rat, a mouse, a frog, and several porcupines, but sadly no fireflies.\nBack at the guest house we saw our final creature of the forest - a leech attached to my neck. I have no idea how it had gotten there. Apparently 15% DEET (the highest you can buy here) wasn&#39;t a strong enough <strong>deet</strong>erent.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> To be fair to the leech, and the DEET, there is a chance that Daniel missed spaying that particuar bit of skin as it was very near the neck line. How it got on to his neck though is anyones guess, they can&#39;t really climb.</span> After removing (and flushing) the leech, wecould see it was just a small cut, but it bled a lot. Leeches apply an anticoagulant to stop blood clots, so I significantly bled through my first plaster. A makeshift absorbant pad of toilet paper micropore-taped to my neck worked much better.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Malaysia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xe1OYZst8ICalobEtu09f-YmiLaHbLVWE0SY-7rqnzopBOikNhTHjks4sG3va-trpsge9doMsH6vYr8Rk7DPiuiiblNP8NQVU-tcmblQE2u6htUsAhIrbAUuZFkmMmn41Af-_sHyyU0=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Apparently the cafe uses this tiger to scare away the monkeys","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G30YZgZ577XC1cS3Q6GmYmsI-dV6_i1Z_OzWjRxeNuq8ZOdD8te4lvrCGzU_ULOOeApuPBtK__u6hA6lIQuMJjJzWa5JKdCLGiRv72y2IgS-8a274KuFinmwZQPrzuZzYe_9GYH7XK4=w2400","width":1920,"height":1080,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"We got very wet","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WDZKttx3Ds74jfaUbBJ5iUJaf4EKfTYcCVMKox-s12Bp5-dXYEk3X9pj7iM_VdvmZsVaTEQ6yVZcJxqvmQ-L9Bg3dYSNI-rjiHjPCa6aTWmNgKoBoUshgKwlFdWMyPNuIvuL8tyBIYs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"A frog!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8mnvHWkQSUguco81ghszp1G8XrRVTicz-6QrXty5omu9WVzThOXuTFnh-UuDMxTMwZZYbmQKUeSlNEGW4BGmMTPjlYpoUViC7D6E387p18nW6GV4quVv4VG3ek8Elm_VYRAwZfq0IXo=w2400","width":2399,"height":3928,"aspectRatio":0.6107433808553971,"caption":"Daniel got leeched!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":62,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Taman Negara","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":64,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Kuala Lumpur","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>64, \"previous\"=>63, \"next\"=>65}":{"data":{"day":{"number":64,"date":"2018-03-08","post":{"content":"<p>I&#39;ve let the time run away with me again and I&#39;m writing this six days and two\ncountries later in Indonesia ...</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this was another traveling day to get back to a major hub (Kuala\nLumpur) in preparation for a flight the next day.

If you\nlived in Singapore it&#39;s probably not worth cooking - so much great choice is\navailable for so little money relative to how much people make. This morning\nwe had a dosa and a biryani (briyani here). So good, but I ended up very full.</p>\n\n<p>As we were getting food it began to rain, with ominous clouds promising more\nlater in the day. Our plan was to go on a walking tour, so we definitely\nneeded some cover. Unfortunately, while packing the bag for the day our water\nhad leaked, drenching my coat. So, after breakfast, we picked up Rosie&#39;s coat\nand bought me a lovely bright blue poncho for $1 so that all of Singapore\ncould identify me more easily as a tourist.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> He only had to wear it for like\n15 minutes... Besides I think the whole world knows that Daniel is a tourist\neven without the poncho.</span></p>\n\n<p>We took the subway (MRT here) to the centre of town to join our\npay-what-you-want walking tour called Sneak Peak Singapore. We joined a group\nof about 20 others with our guide being a young local guy of Chinese descent\nin a pink t-shirt. He&#39;d recently finished his degree in urban planning and now\nworked for the government planning department, which definitely coloured the\ncontent of the tour. Not that I&#39;m complaining; the planned-out nature of\nSingapore and it&#39;s development was fascinating to learn about.</p>\n\n<p>We started by the river with a brief intro to the early history of Singapore\n700 years ago, then skipped to the start of British influence in the early\n19th century. Darren, our guide, explained the politics of the area at the\ntime and how the British asked for a trading port in Singapore after lending\nmilitary aid to an elder brother of the ruling family of the Johore Sultanate\nwho&#39;s younger brother had taken the throne. They&#39;d then not charged any tax\nat the port, enabling it to outcompete the Dutch ports in the same area (the\nStraits of Melacca).<span  class=\"Rosie\"> This was all explained with the help of a map and some\nlaminated pictures that he pulled from his magical bag.</span></p>\n\n<p>We then made our way through Chinatown, learning plenty as we went. It is\nfairly central, so is surrounded by skyscrapers, but four of its districts\nhave been preserved with the old two to five storey shophouses. They&#39;re\npretty thin as the colonial government used to tax buildings by the width of\ntheir shopfront on the main street, not by area, leading to long, thin\nbuildings up to five times longer than they were wide.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> At this point it\nbegan to rain so we all pulled on coats and ponchos and for those that didn&#39;t\nhave a poncho with them Darren pulled about a dozen of them from his magical\nbag. It only rained for about 15 minutes though which was nice because when it\ndid rain, it rained really heavily.</span></p>\n\n<p>Darren also pointed out the original shore line of Singapore, now two\nkilometres from the sea. Huge amounts of Singapore are built on reclaimed land\n- something like 25%. The earth came from hills, many of which used to be in\nChinatown. These used to give rise to a large number of wells, forming the\ncity&#39;s primary water source. Water was transported in barrels on oxcarts and\nwas so common that it affects the area&#39;s name even now. In many other cities,\nthe Chinatown is called something like &quot;Chinese street&quot; in Chinese, but here\nit is the three words &quot;ox&quot;, &quot;water&quot; and &quot;cart&quot; (I forget the ordering).<span  class=\"Rosie\"> At\nthis point it was getting rather hot so Darren pulled some fans and some frozen\nwet wipes out from his magical bag to pass around so we could cool ourselves\ndown... you&#39;re starting to see why I think this bag is magic.</span></p>\n\n<p>As we walked, Darren also pointed out some other sides of Singapore. We passed\nan electricity substation which had a sign on it warning people not to enter.\nIt didn&#39;t say it was a substation, it had a picture of a soldier aiming a\nrifle at another man with his hands up. Darren said that this was better than\nit used to be - ten years ago, the signs were all over the place and the\nwithout the gun had been lying on the ground. Apparently now they ask\nquestions before shooting ...</p>\n\n<p>At several points we tried Singaporean food: at a Chinese bakery, a\nPeranakan (mixed Chinese &amp; Malay going back 700 years) sweet cafe and at\nanother hawker court. The Peranakan sweets (kueh) were delicious - mixtures of\ngelatinous rice with various fruit flavours and creams and some pastry. I got\nto taste durian, which was pretty good, but I don&#39;t think it was strongly\nflavoured. The hawker food was also good - Hainan chicken rice (what it sounds\nlike), popiah (the best spring rolls we&#39;ve had so far - a variety of veg with\na slightly sweet sauce and crunchy partly-ground peanuts), and carrot cake.\nCarrot cake is a misnomer - apparently the word for &quot;carrot&quot; and &quot;white\nradish&quot; are very similar in Chinese, but I&#39;ve no idea why it&#39;s called cake.\nIt&#39;s ground radish and rice, made into balls, then fried. The &quot;black&quot; version,\nwhich we had, is also cooked in soy sauce. It&#39;s a slightly odd, soft texture,\nbut good. I probably won&#39;t be making it any time soon (unlike the popiahs).<span  class=\"Rosie\">\nWe also learned that at hawker centers in singapore, if you place a small, cheap\nitem on the table, it is considered reserved and no one else will sit there.\nCue Darren and his magical bag which held several of such items.</span></p>\n\n<p>We ended at a government housing block, where we learnt that 81% of people\nhere live in government housing. We&#39;re not exactly sure what he meant by\n&quot;government housing&quot;, but probably government <strong>built</strong> housing, as it can\nbe sold after 5 years. The government owns the building after the 99 year\nlease comes to term. The housing seems pretty good - according to Darren, the\nprivate equivalent is the same standard except with a swimming pool, a balcony\nand a security guard you don&#39;t need. The government flats we saw were around\n1 million US dollars while the private ones were another 700,000.</p>\n\n<p>The government flats also drew our attention to some of the interesting\napproaches of the Singapore government. They use social engineering quite a\nbit (but not in the cyber-security sense). Darren described it as trying to\ncreate the ideal society, but using pragmatic approaches rather than waiting\nfor ideal solutions. For example, some time after the subway was introduced,\npeople kept leaving chewing gum on the doors, causing them to jam, preventing\nthe train from moving and screwing up the entire system. The government\nreaction was to ban the sale and purchase of chewing gum, which remains to\nthis day. Another example is that to prevent hippy culture, in the sixties\nforeign men with long hair had to cut it before entering the country and local\nmen with long hair were served last at all government offices. Finally, a more\nserious example is that in order to buy a government flat, you need to be\nmarried or have proof that you will marry soon. The government believes that\nthe nuclear (heterosexual) family is the building block and uses this method\nto encourage that.</p>\n\n<p>Also interesting was some of the personal financial policy. For an average\nsalary (very roughly S$5000/$3750/£2500 per month), the income tax rate is\nonly 3.5%. However, 20% is put into a compulsory savings account, with another\n17% added by your employer. This can only be spent on:\n  * your own (or immediate family&#39;s) healthcare\n* property\n* your children&#39;s education\n* your pension</p>\n\n<p>Healthcare is not free and there is no welfare state, and while there are\nprovisions for those with low incomes, it is possible to fall through the\ncracks in the system and be dependent on charity funds.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, we went up to the 50th floor of one of seven government housing blocks\nwhich were linked by a roof terrace at that level. They&#39;re also linked by an\n800m running track surrounding them 24 floors below. The view was amazing,\njust on the outskirts of downtown, near many of the skyscrapers. Recent\nplanning policy has made it compulsory for all new buildings to have <strong>at\nleast 100%</strong> of the area of the footprint of the building as horizontal green\nspace within the building. This means many of the buildings are very green,\nwith garden levels and rooftop parks - even some with plants growing up the\nheight of the building on the outer walls.</p>\n\n<p>We ended our tour and made our way to two light shows, both of which were\nfree. The first was in the Gardens by the Bay, a pretty recently developed\npublic garden space built (like everywhere else) on reclaimed land. The light\nshow is in the supertree grove (shown on Planet Earth 2). The supertrees are\nmassive pink metal structures reminiscent of branching trees with plants\ngrowing up around the struts. They are impressive and would be imposing if it\nwasn&#39;t for the nearby skyscrapers.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It is pretty cool but there is a lot of\nconcrete around for something that is a garden, it could do with a bit more\ngreen.</span></p>\n\n<p>We lay on the ground with the crowds in the centre of the grove and watched\nthe trees light up to a variety of Disney soundtracks culminating with Star\nWars. It was somewhat bizarre, but so is the rest of the place. We had dinner\nin the gardens&#39; own hawker court, Satay by the Bay. Rosie enjoyed the satay\nwhile I went for another Indian bread, murtabak - a stuffed pancake, in this\ncase with mutton.</p>\n\n<p>We then left the park, walking alonside the water to the hulking Marina Bay\nSands hotel - three huge, curved tower blocks supporting a slightly bent\nplatform almost like a ship above them. It also has a light show set within\nthe bay, this time made primarily from water jets. It also creates moving\npictures from lights shone through sprayed mist. At points, the jets looked\nlike lava and the music was overwhelmingly loud. The hard rock was somewhat\nover the top and didn&#39;t quite go with the gentle singing. Pretty odd.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It\nwas very very intense, espcially after the twinkly lights and disney music of\nthe super trees.</span></p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Singapore","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4WgC4UkeizAQR9i4QK-HQsLH1SV4BjNLo2Je9_ELpsFeYKLMRUXj9mJBS2SGehG5bOoPwOHov36eOUy2i1fTj4vDUhdrDWvQ-jgOlHcBlhHV1Fus0PDbCR90QqOZcUoVNbIOYz231fE=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"The oldest bridge in singapore, built in Glasgow no less.","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5BgYS64QCGeHU33Pq5sCiyqEs-rt1juBu0nKkWmigGBEEWv2O8thSymOjMWi-PbobjR2gVAk1FQ3Klv-bSeMLhMT96-eVkzBosr3MHOzV9BWMJdgHRF7U9ej6sdLSAb4kMrYY6hj7p4=w2400","width":2400,"height":1160,"aspectRatio":2.0689655172413794,"caption":"Mural of life in chinatown 50 years ago","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F_NKgFGrLcYV9ozytS2jAUn51wSK8l6uVpYgsY5qF7TfhIoZcFWPTMaaxWWIzs0SiK2MMBIneWdx4yZ0DOmUEJ5Jk-syLVF2lWkP2Cn-yCyZAoHaAGbbp-bnWU0UiksnhvL7fSmBzks=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Don't go in there","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/llSrId4R1ptSSecpEWsR5ZzK0QJawq71j_ohYKdodpcpWv2hBbxaORxew5cNDbrvupZcRuMc5YdsDF9lz13j5-l7fNvmlRLnlbuYP30wHn9dYCXZY3jdLs80fl9sBlOnIY4ZQVdSIhI=w2400","width":2400,"height":986,"aspectRatio":2.4340770791075053,"caption":"City skyline from the 50th floor","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DQmTc29Q6eTC7tISLoGBaxzyY5GohRUawjDGKPy70IzpYaU3rQa47LskF8BOhSVtcIUgxbe3DXm7pmmyIHUsTUfd8rUwtcHyMYbWLyZZz2Pl3H4CFrCN1_u_L8ogTMTd0qIDPY7q7X4=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Up high","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/l97x7ow-XNOL5O3uCDDF4g5La5vKODiGsg4U2kNE5E6z6_JbOgrbiPtzma76KaI9O-kuwVkPf9biwGDtoErbYxTKqPywapgGkLuUp81NKf01wffxvuV9az5PudDzyY6o5mkpJCuaXa0=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"The super trees","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z0palJ-LdeSxbi77YXurUs2PtK6khitzXbI5StYQSoPEmR3kmeO_YTANv0EwLn59y1mwSUatW6wMjVrjW-3EVeWaQvriKqDrt0hrc3D2YW52UrbMVkjptU1PhGPGlHwfwxr14QnrYIs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"City at night","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":65,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Kuala Lumpur","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":67,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Singapore","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>67, \"previous\"=>66, \"next\"=>68}":{"data":{"day":{"number":67,"date":"2018-03-11","post":{"content":"<p>Our time in Singapore was brief - this was our second and last full day there.\nWe went for a traditional breakfast of kaya toast, which was surprisingly\ngood.

We started at the Buddha&#39;s tooth temple, which, unsurprisingly,\nhoused a tooth believed to have been from the Buddha (surrounded by gold).</p>\n\n<p>We spent most of the rest of the day in and around the Gardens by the Bay.\nThere were loads of signs around saying what to do if you encountered an\notter, so we hoped to spot one, but failed to. <span  class=\"Rosie\"> Sad</span> We walked through the gardens\nin the heat and up to a large water reserve with a good view of the skyline\nand plenty of locals flying impressive kites. We then made our way to the paid\nparts of the gardens - two huge glass domes.</p>\n\n<p>The first was the cloud forest, a huge structure with plants from many cloud\nforests around the world at different levels. It had a lift to the top, then\na walkway down, around and through the structure. It also, kind of\nludicrously, claims to have the world&#39;s highest indoor waterfall.</p>\n\n<p>It was crowded, but impressive. Just after we arrived, lots of small hoses\nstarted letting out streams of mist all over the place. There were plenty of\nstrange plants, including the carniverous ones. The carniverous pitcher plants\nand venus fly traps were right at the top, interspersed with larger Lego\nreconstructions of the plants themselves.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> There was\nalso a beautiful collection of many many orchids and a some what sobering\nvideo and exhibit on climate change and the effect of humanity on nature. I\nreally hope that the many locals watching the video saw and were moved by it,\nthe level of single use plastic in SEA is rediculous. I can&#39;t even count how\nmany times I&#39;ve told someone I do not need a plastic bag.</span></p>\n\n<p>We then went to the flower dome - a bit smaller and currently focusing on\nmediterannean climates. There were cool baobab trees and several plants we\nrecognised from our gardens at home, especially as one of the four regions\nbeing shown was California. Unfortunately, the display was in the process of\nbeing changed, so some plants (mainly the cherry trees) were not in flower.</p>\n\n<p>We went back to Satay by the Bay to verify that popiah were just as good there\nas in the other hawker court (they were). We then went to a rooftop bar called\nLevel 33 (guess what floor it&#39;s on ...) with a view of the bay and the light\nshows. The drink prices were exorbitant, but it felt like we might as well go\nfor a Singapore sling while we&#39;re here. The sneaky bar didn&#39;t include the\n10% service charge or 7% GST in their menu prices. However, the view, once we\ngot a table by the edge, was great.</p>\n\n<p>The only real downpoint was losing a bit of money on the subway. There&#39;s a\nprepaid card you can buy for $5 which significantly reduces the price of\ntickets, but only lets you travel if it has over about $2.50 on it.

This\ncut that down by at least half an hour.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Starting to panic.</span></p>\n\n<p>The flight was fine, but didn&#39;t make up any time. Our bags were pretty late\non the conveyor belt (we&#39;ve been pretty lucky normally), but immigration was\npretty quick. Then we faced the organisation of Jakarta airport.</p>\n\n<p>Jakarta airport has three terminals. We landed in terminal 2 and needed to\nget to terminal 1. There didn&#39;t seem to be any signs, but an official\npointed us to the skytrain. This is outside the building and not as frequent\nas we would have liked - every 15 minutes in each direction, and we <strong>just</strong>\nmissed one.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Actually panicing now.</span>  Twenty five minutes later we were at terminal 1, or rather\nterminal 1B. Our tickets didn&#39;t say which part of terminal 1 we needed. We\ntried to go in, but were told to go to terminal 1C, a few minutes&#39; trolley-run\nbehind us.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> AHHHHHH!!!</span></p>\n\n<p>At terminal 1C, we had to through some bag-scanning security just to get in.\nWe were divided by gender here, which hasn&#39;t really happened to us at airports\nbefore. Once inside, we found the shortest queue as there was now less than an\nhour until our flight left. Several flights around hours were boarding, but\nwhen Rosie talked to the guy shouting &quot;Lombok!&quot; he just pointed to go back to\nour line. Eventually, someone realised we needed to get through quickly and\nso the woman at the desk processed us alongside the two guys ahead of us,\ntaking our passports, running out of the departure hall and returing with\nboarding passes (maybe her printer was out of paper? Not sure).<span  class=\"Rosie\"> By this\npoint we were somewhere between very nervous and very fed up. It often feels\nlike no one in SEA really knows what is going on.</span></p>\n\n<p>We ran out of the departure hall, taking the escalator steps two at a time.\nThere was more security, so we were separated by gender again, then got\nthrough to an area with a few shops, but far less than outside the departure\nhall. We rushed to our gate lounge, only to sit there for at least twenty\nminutes. The time for our flight to leave came and went while the board\nstubbrnly insisted our flight was &quot;on schedule&quot;. At least we didn&#39;t have\nanother connection. This was the only place we&#39;d had time to consider lunch,\nbut there was only a tiny little shop. The smells earlier of the Rotiboy\nbakeries had been so enticing as we&#39;d run past, but the chocolate bun I bought\ndidn&#39;t live up to them at all.</p>\n\n<p>The flight, once we got on it, was surprisingly good. It was only 110 minutes,\nbut we got a reasonable meal and entertainment - I hadn&#39;t seen Antz in years.</p>\n\n<p>We got to Lombok and realised pretty quickly we were a world away from\nSingapore, back to hundreds of people asking you if you want a taxi every time\nyou take a step. We managed, despite the internet failing, to get a Grab car\nfrom just outside the airport (probably because of taxi drivers preventing\nGrab drivers coming there - I&#39;ve herad of it elsewhere). As we drove\nthrough Lombok the differences from Singapore were stark - tiny, relatively\nramshackle buildings and much poorer infrastructure. Our driver stopped to try\nand buy drinking water, which would be unnecessary in Singapore as the tap\nwater is safe to drink. There were far more scooters on the road and we passed\na substantial accident where a digger had crashed on corner.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most Grab drivers, our driver was pretty chatty - at least, to me. He\ndidn&#39;t ever try and engage Rosie in conversation, only ever asking me\nquestions about her. I assumed this was due to the fact that we&#39;re now in the\nlargest Islamic country in the world, but it was still pretty weird.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> This\ndid nothing to improve my mood. I am all for differences in culture but I did\nnot appriciate being ignored in this way. It is rude.</span></p>\n\n<p>We arrived at quite a nice guest house with a surprisingly big room, complete\nwith a little veranda. We headed into town (Kuta) for dinner, expecting the\nsame as in smaller tourist towns - plenty of restaurants, not much variety.\nHowever, it seems like we&#39;ve done well here, to the point that we&#39;re spoilt\nfor choice. As well as the ever-present burgers and pizza, there&#39;s\ngreat-looking Mediterranean food, crepes, galletes, local food, and more. I\nhad a really good local fried rice (or nasi goreng here) while Rosie continued\nto check out the satay.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Guys peanut sauce is the best!</span></p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Singapore","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Indonesia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":67,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Singapore","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":69,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Lombok","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>69, \"previous\"=>68, \"next\"=>70}":{"data":{"day":{"number":69,"date":"2018-03-13","post":{"content":"<p>We got up pretty late (about 10am) this morning to try and catch up on sleep.\nIt didn&#39;t work very well as the room was pretty warm despite the fan.\nBreakfast was included in our guest house and, after ordering, it turned out\nto be served on our veranda outside our room.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The people who ran the guest \nhouse were lovely although the breakfast was somewhat sad.</span></p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, we headed into town with the intention of going surfing, which is\nthe main thing to do here.

Along the way the roads were much more\nsimilar to Cambodia and Vietnam than they were to Malaysia, never mind\nSingapore. Small corrugated iron buildings dotted the side of the road with\nstray dogs roaming freely. There were far more scooters than cars, and after\nten minutes we came upon someone who&#39;d been thrown from their scooter after\nhitting a dog. The seemed to be fine, but shaken. The same couldn&#39;t be said\nfor either the dog or the scooter.</p>\n\n<p>We pulled up to the beach and got out while the guys unfastened the surfboards\nfrom the roof of the car. We could see the waves in the distance but the place\nseemed empty - great. The waves were a reef break, meaning that they were\nbreaking far enough off shore that we were brought out by a small boat.\nDespite going out hundreds of metres, it didn&#39;t get much deeper.

We took our foam boards off the boat\nand paddled out. The waves were only breaking in one particular area, meaning\nit was easy enough to avoid the break and paddle around them to the left and\nright.

As part of that, on the day before\nNyepi (today), people in Balinese towns parade giant, demonic effigies called\nogoh-ogoh through their towns in the evening to drive out all of the evil\nspirits. Tomorrow, the entire island of four million people will shut down,\nwith no travel and very little noise or light, so that the evil spirits pass\nover the island.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It is very impressive that they can shut down an entire\nisland including the airport. They also shut off the internet.</span></p>\n\n<p>We had a snack dinner at a restaurant recommended by Denise very close by to\nthe area the ogoh-ogoh were going to gather at. After eating, we joined the\ncrowds lining the streets as they began to arrive. They&#39;re all sorts of\nshapes and sizes, primarily twisted, partly-human figures, but not always.\nThey&#39;re made from foam and cloth, presumably with a wire or bamboo frame,\nsometimes with coloured electic lights set into them or their frame to shine\nonto them. They&#39;re supported on large lattices of bamboo poles, creating\nsquares up to 8x8 or 9x9 with groups of men, women or children carrying them,\none person per bamboo cell and the effigy taking up the centre. All in all,\nit&#39;s reminiscent of a St Patrick&#39;s Day parade (which is tomorrow), but held at\nnight and somehow combined with Halloween.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> And also louder and more chaotic.</span></p>\n\n<p>Once they had all arrived in a large, open field, we (along with thousands of\nothers) moved between them, looking at them more closely and taking photos.\nMany had their own strangely-coloured light sources and one even had an\nin-built smoke machine.</p>\n\n<p>After a while, a torch-lit procession began to lead them all back up the\nstreet to the centre of town. The larger ogoh-ogoh were so tall that they\nwould have become entangled in the overhead electrical wires, so had to have\nmen with long bamboo poles to lift the wires out of the way while the\nprocession passed. This just added to the general mayhem of the day - around\nfifty people shouting as they carried the ogoh-ogoh, with others shouting to\nstop them before they entangled with the wires, then to go when the wires were\nlifted, with thousands of people on the street and bands of drummers and\ncymbalists(?) adding to the general racket.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It was somewhere between hilarious\nand very impressive, particuarly as the larger ogoh-ogoh looked very heavy and\nthe men carrying them looked exhasuted by the end of the night. However some\nof the smaller ogoh-ogoh were carried by children who appeared to be having\nthe time of their lives.</span></p>\n\n<p>The crossroads at the centre was heaving, but we managed to get a place on the\nstreet with an ok view (gradually getting better as we made our way to the\nfront). It turned out the ogoh-ogoh were from four or five different groups\nwho then took it in turns to put on a show in the street, with music and\ndancers, followed by the ogoh-ogoh. Large groups of people would carry the\nogoh-ogoh, moving them up and down, spinning around and running up the street\nas the tightly-packed crowd quickly backed up (I only fell over once in the\nthrong). The aim seemed partly to be to shake the effigies so hard that they\nbroke - the crowd shouted the loudest when one of the wolf-men broke in half\nand when one of the hag-like female ogoh-ogoh lost her head.</p>\n\n<p>The original processions started around 6pm, but these performances didn&#39;t end\nuntil well after 11pm.

Denise arranged a taxi for us to Denpasar airport. The journey took\na surprising amount of time because of all the traffic, but sped up once we\nreached a large toll road built over the water.

For the\nsecond time this trip I found a key that I should have returned in my pocket\nat security ...</p>\n\n<p>The food in the domestic lounge was pretty decent. I had a reasonable fried\nduck and rice while Rosie had gado gado - an Indonesian dish of vegetables,\npeanut sauce, and, at least in this instance, rice crackers. Also, to my\ndelight, there was a Beard Papa stall, so we were able to have some more of\ntheir delicious cream puffs.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Gado gado, or at least good gado gado, is\namazing. I mean I know I have bit of a thing for peanut sauce but its just so\ngood.</span></p>\n\n<p>Our gate was changed and neither of us fully heard the announcement, but\nluckily decided to check it out. There was no longer a line at the gate, but\nstill time before the flight left. Cream puffs in hand, we made it onto the\nplane.</p>\n\n<p>In less than an hour, we touched down in Labuan Bajo, Flores. We were picked\nup by a taxi from our hotel, which actually isn&#39;t that far away. The hotel\nis pretty nice with a decent large room and a helpful owner who gave us lots\nof advice.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> He also paid for the taxi, as he had said he would come and pick\nus up but his father had taken the car.

We walked down into the centre from our hotel to arrange our next couple\nof days, checking out four or five of the tour agencies.

Thankfully, our hotel provided us with\nbreakfast and was happy to do so at 4.50am (prearranged), so we had a\nsurprisingly tasty omelette and fruit.</p>\n\n<p>We had a full-day tour booked, starting at 5.30am in town, a 20 minute walk\naway. We arrived and waited a while, then were taken to the harbour to wait\nin our boat for more people. A little annoyed that we could have slept for\nlonger, we waited for around half an hour for our long, thin boat to fill up\nwith eventually ten other people. We had seats on one side of a thin table at\nthe front, meaning people had to squeeze past us or the Japanese couple across\nfrom us to walk the length of the boat.</p>\n\n<p>Dawn came and went very quickly, then the boat chugged out of the packed\nharbour into the sea. We dozed as the (slow) boat spent maybe a couple of\nhours getting to Padar island, our first stop. This is a particularly\npicturesque island, full of sharp limestone peaks and surrounded by clear\nblue water and sheltered coves. We walked along a path up a hill (with plenty\nof other tourists) and enjoyed the view over the island and the others near\nby.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The views were lovely and the tourists started to peter out as we got\nfurther up the mountain.</span></p>\n\n<p>An hour or so later, our next stop was the island of Komodo to pay our park\nfees and see Komodo dragons, the largest lizards in the world. We went on a\nshort walk to a man-made watering hole (currently turned off), where there\nwere three adult male Komodos lying in wait for prey that comes to drink.\nApparently it&#39;s a common hunting technique for them - appear asleep, then\nsprint at 20km an hour to kill deer or pigs (we saw both not too far away).\nThey are impressive creatures, more than two metres long. I did feel sorry for\nthe park rangers, however, spending day after day telling tourists not to get\nto close in case they get seriously injured ...<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Mind you they do pretend\nto be asleep and then sprint to catch their prey so I would also be very\ncautious with anyone in my care. &lt;/R.</p>\n\n<p>We then took our boat to a beach near by with almost pink sand. The boat\nanchored maybe 50m out and we donned snorkeling gear before jumping into the\nwater. Unfortunately, my mask fogged up within a minute no matter what I did\nto clean it, so I spent a lot of time with salt water in my eyes and a foggy\nmask. However, we did manage to see quite a few fish as we swam and dived.</p>\n\n<p>We were the last back to the boat which had already started moving when we got\nthere. For some reason, we were told to swim to the back to hand up our fins,\nthen swim/haul ourselves to the front of the boat while it was moving to get\nup the steps. Not particularly comfortable or necessary, as a crew member just\nbrought our fins to the front of the boat when we got out.</p>\n\n<p>Our last stop was at manta point, where, you guessed it, we managed to see\nmanta rays. At least one anyway. The boat slowed out to sea as the water\nbecame shallower and clear, maybe 15m deep. A member of the crew came up to\nthe front, staring down into the water. After a few minutes, he pointed to the\nfront right, shouting &quot;There! Jump!&quot;. I caught a glimpse of a huge black ray\nseeming to flap its way through the water before rushing to get my snorkeling\ngear.</p>\n\n<p>We spent maybe half an hour with lots of people in the water swimming after a\nmanta until it was lost, then holding onto the side of the boat while people\non our boat and the other few near by searched for another manta, only to\nrepeat the process. I didn&#39;t get a better look than that first glimpse,\npossibly because my mask was still fogging up. The look I got was great,\nthough.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I got a pretty good view and they are just amazingly magnificant\ncreatures, the way they swim is just beautiful.</span></p>\n\n<p>On the way home I warmed up and dried off on the roof of the boat, which, in\nretrospect probably wasn&#39;t my best decision of the trip. I&#39;d made it this far\nwithout getting properly sunburnt shoulders - ah well.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> To be fair Daniel\nhas managed 3 months in SEA without getting properly sunburnt, which given his\npropensity to get sunburnt is pretty impresive.</span></p>\n\n<p>We had some reasonable sushi for dinner, along with gnocchi that was better\nthan the food from the Italian place the night before. We decided on how and\nwhere we wanted to go on the Gili islands, our next place, and booked most of\nthat.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Indonesia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/De3wD-0PRXX6XRenAOdwwU__Xrc5516bwF7aJPqvJRBpcQLLs_8637PLUyLPUESAiF0Cl9ZauguwqPREYG59Ex-4PYctfplMaUAHhlLvADiyRADooUhSFpK7txHOYVvpB1f7OTafL54=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"On top of Padar island","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2hAwirEBWXVM0trw6TlI1l4PCKBeYA3Z0d8FWmVavdt4hAyD0YU5PEggQZtBlZL8zSyrPiQTQtlzUPI0u-RY1uI2b9KsDYDLBENl3FhhnCELuGx_5PuyaFDv_OIzTeuJ-MKcMcnYVpY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Daniel surveying the scene","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vC9kK_BAvZHhOoBwIcNNwH8L89xklPnQKgNpBg5lV_jJmphAbxiih9W2yC9qtH6YGcpmwro7uc2dXP734wXdN1E8hRDPb_39Sup5uiyU4qtkCayGVy1v57yMmeGALnUHUJjcpHmeLRU=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Beautiful view","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NsoPPLKE0bp1PsEaGGj8h5L0Mjjn4d5rdHe7S1S_77MOMbGBEYvrxYl2HWYlEvz5MJlBi00dWBRvu6eTAdlJpN2oZ8l8umjKgGzjZBwC0jmaJ1mpdPUk9Bau2kjfJuinXmgHjUtHQVA=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Padar island","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mwPYeAM7SF59iHde-sEeQE6A7sMTSPnOLE7vFeXGTWethj2x0GLdb68hOH3hAILGtGkPslY9TJWAcs-5sCk-bzSJioZ224em3WDOyhPt90QyLYamgaXZUVLu0Le0f4D_IuIr3P2n4sY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Don't we look adorable","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M2W-I-DGVOd54Ko5S6uvI11Se83QZRSIh48PKEwzLhrBFQlx-fPRT_j8VZspan0j1UkDxCHlqlwg3dHJ1D_7Es9RAXsxxA9h2zUrzNvk0Maq18aomHpOfGBvKNs88hxhx5CsSxksfIY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Lazy dragon","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nv9vCMMsVlmn62vs5Shr8K8uG1Kkm4wX_QZulwocBj-7pW0IICDAgzt97UN9iSTl1YtpaC6iZejGkLjqwz8O02pTeSDzqphgZIq8G9KP8yzx274eLCUJd_BlfkTpG22BgggBDlrpnqs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Here there be dragons","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/alkij3qN178PwL-4sdLgA_I-RRGyuqRliEMNZAFMS1PYyaVWqPBG8BekXdGLQPAFFHdM1TOVO0TC8Vs4wZKK9DmzbC0FdD20TDd9UwxWAEDt96yPLpBLreCtqTCTH9-yxZ35ZsxdWRs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Komodo national park","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AMPqdRXfEBtj8EYKvG1Ym_HcK0WRgz4c7MRG5j2wWNeOUrGG__oES24hkPBnvEvrpL0lN9FTxuv6a9oF-ZothNoI__cMsdq-oDIViW7-3taVVdrx6haeh2rofV397fbNfjVOcjDzOQo=w2400","width":1805,"height":1587,"aspectRatio":1.137366099558916,"caption":"Clown fish will defend their territory by swimming out and getting in your face","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":74,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Bali","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":76,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Flores","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>76, \"previous\"=>75, \"next\"=>77}":{"data":{"day":{"number":76,"date":"2018-03-20","post":{"content":"<p>We had another tour booked for today, but starting at the more civilised time\nof 8.30am. When we arrived we were greeted with a lime iced tea at their\nrestaurant and told that no one else had booked today, so we had the boat to\nourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Like the day before, we walked down to the harbour, but this time got a small\nboat out to where our boat was moored (rather than wedged into the press of\nboats at the jetty). Today&#39;s trip was double yesterday&#39;s in cost (excluding the\npark fees, which were large), and it showed on the boat. It was the same type,\nbut well painted and more comfortable - a larger table, longer benches and\nbean bags towards the back. Like yesterday, there was tea, coffee and water\nprovided. In addition, there was a big bunch of ripe green bananas. We didn&#39;t\nmake much of a dent in them despite my attempts - there&#39;s only so many bananas\none person can eat and for some reason Rosie didn&#39;t want any.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Nope.</span></p>\n\n<p>We had three separate destinations, all for snorkeling and all to the north\nrather than the east, so not in the national park. Our first was around a\njetty off an island, where we saw plenty of fish of many different kinds. I\nhad a bit of difficulty with my mask fogging, but not as bad as yesterday.\nAfter a while it began to get cold, so we headed back to the boat. Right at\nthe jetty we spotted a black moray eel poking out from a crack in the rock\nwhich (hopefully) we got some half-decent footage of (I was goProing at the\ntime).<span  class=\"Rosie\"> We also saw a huge numner of fish and some great blue starfish, I \nalso a ray but Daniel sadly missed it.</span></p>\n\n<p>Our next stop was a tiny little island with a shelf of rock and sandy beach\nwith one other boat already there. We snorkeled part way around the island,\nspending most of our time at the wall where the reef descended sharply into\ndeeper water. As we were getting in the water Rosie spotted a small shark and\nshot off to film it.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It promptly shot off away from me, maybe it is camera\nshy...</span> After some time swimming around and duck diving down to\nget closer to the coral, we began to get cold again and headed towards the\nboat. The water began to heat up a bit, so we spent a bit more time closer to\nshore, then went back to the boat.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The area we were swimming around in has\nvery strong currents and lots of wierd streams so while one bit of ocean would \nbe freezing the area just next to it would be nice and warm.</span></p>\n\n<p>We were served a delicious chicken and coconut milk curry with rice for lunch\nwith little biscuits to follow. We had a bit of a lie down on the bean bags\nafterwards as two of the three crew members had a bit of a snooze.</p>\n\n<p>Our last stop was just off another island, this one just large enough to host\na small hut and apparently some chickens given the frequent cock-a-doodle-doos\nwe heard. There was a line of buoys out to prevent boats going into a\nparticular area which we discovered hosted plenty of wire frames with coral\nattached, presumably as an attempt to regrow some of the reef. One of the\ncrew members had said that the reef at our first spot used to be better, but\nhadn&#39;t had the protection of being in the national park. The coral on the\nframes did seem more vibrant, at least in colour, than elsewhere and was\ncovered with fish. I really enjoyed diving down beside the wall and looking\nunder the frames to see the large fish there and the tiny ones among the\ncoral.</p>\n\n<p>As we finished snorkeling, a party boat (maybe a liveaboard for divers?)\npulled up near by, blaring music. We slowly made our way away from them and\nback to Labuan Bajo. Back at port, we said goodbye, showered back at the\nhotel, and went back into town. Rosie was craving some tacos (taco Tuesday -\nI&#39;m impressed I know what day it is), so we went to the town&#39;s taqueria.\nDespite quite a tasty papaya salsa, it didn&#39;t quite live up to expectations.</p>\n\n<p>I finished off the day with a bit of diary writing, but didn&#39;t quite get up

When we had\narrived, our host at the hotel had offered to take us to a couple of local\nsites free of charge, so we asked to do that today.</p>\n\n<p>The first stop was at a large limestone cave which, if you&#39;re lucky (we\nweren&#39;t) you can see the refracted light from the sun. We had a guide and a\ntrainee show us around, pointing out massive stalagmites and stalagtites. They\ntook us into a natural room further within the cave complex where the roof was\nancient coral complete with a fossilized turtle. </p>\n\n<p>On our way to the other attraction of the day in the battered old SUV we got\nchatting to our host, originally from Lombok. He&#39;d come to Flores in 2005 and\nworked as a tour salesman, but by the sounds of things had become addicted to\nonline gambling. He then conned tourists out of money to fund it, then went on\nthe run across Indonesia. He ended up in prison for a couple of years and said\nafter living on the street it was significantly preferrable. He&#39;d now seen the\nerror of his ways and gave free tours to tourists (like the one we were on) as\na way of repenting. The hotel we were staying in belongs to his father, who&#39;d\ngiven him a job after he was released, but had refused to help him when he was\ndown, saying he had to clean up his own mess. He now values that harsh\nfairness from his father.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> He was a very interesting person to talk to and \nwas by all accounts lovely but I&#39;m very glad we met this side of him rather \nthan the other side. We also got to talking about politics, both of the US \n(everyone has an opinion on US politics) and of Indonesian politics, which was \ngood to learn a bit more about.</span></p>\n\n<p>He also pointed out a huge new hotel being built, with about 500 rooms each at\ntwice the next most expensive places to stay in Labuan Bajo (which happen to\nbe fancy boat hotels that only have about six rooms). He thinks that there\njust isn&#39;t the demand, so may just be a way of cleaning money. That being\nsaid, apparently it&#39;s fully booked for September, so there&#39;s a lot of pressure\non the workers to finish on time.</p>\n\n<p>Our other stop was an impressive viewpoint from the top of a steep hill down\nonto curved sandy bays with sunlit green and blue sea. There were only a few\nother people around (and the obligatory drone).</p>\n\n<p>Back in Labuan Bajo, we went to the restaurant of the people we&#39;d booked our\nsnorkeling with the day before. We had some pretty good food, including the\nfirst burger we&#39;d ordered so far on the trip (apart from the free burger at\nMarry Brown fast food chain in KL, which may not have been enough of a burger\nto count ...). We wrote a load of postcards, then posted them, only to find\nout that here you get a free postcard with every stamp, so now we have a load\nmore.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> We also found out that the stamps are MASSIVE and so if you&#39;ve \nreceived a postcard with a really big stamp and a sentence that doesn&#39;t make \nsense try peeling back the stamp.</span></p>\n\n<p>We shopped for some souvenirs with some success, wrote a few more diary\nentries, and had some more decent sushi for dinner.

We didn&#39;t have to be\nat the harbour until 11am, so we had a leisurely breakfast and packed\nafterwards. We waited at the harbour for about 45 minutes while talking to a\nCalifornian couple who were traveling after finishing teaching English in\n(South) Korea for a year.</p>\n\n<p>The ferry was loud, bumpy and not direct - we stopped at Gili Air &amp; Lombok\nbefore turning around to head to Bali. It was ok, but not quite as nice as the\nway to Gili Meno (and neither of us saw any dolphins this time). When we\narrived at Padang Bai port we were ushered onto a minibus (while, as usual,\nmany people tried to sell us taxi rides). Before getting on we used probably\none of the dirtiest toilets we&#39;ve seen so far and paid for the privelege.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> \nIt was really very gross.</span></p>\n\n<p>The minivan to the airport was pretty uncomfortable and only had four\npassengers including us. We spent most of the hour and a half journey coming\nup with possible three course meals we could make (both somewhat missing\ncooking). Near the airport the driver told us we had to pay the airport\nentrance fee, which we had also been asked for when leaving the airport in a\nGrab. In both cases it probably should have been included in the fare, but it\nwas a small amount of money ...</p>\n\n<p>We were very early for our flight - it left at 10pm and we arrived at about\n4pm.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> While this may seem like overkill there was a very real possibility \nthat the boat would be over 2 hours late and that the taxi would take twice as \nlong so we decided to play it safe rather than sorry.</span> \nPretty hungry by this point, we went on a hunt for food with a\nfully-laden airport trolley. Of course, wandering outside an airport with\nluggage meant that we were constantly bombarded with calls of &quot;Taxi?&quot; and\n&quot;Where are you going? I give you good price&quot;. When we replied &quot;Sydney,\nAustralia&quot;, some stopped, but many just replied without listening, just saying\n&quot;Yes, cheap price&quot;. Like other places, saying no to a taxi driver meant that\nthe one behind him would ask us the same question, despite clearly seeing us\nsay no to the first ...<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I got quite angry at one point, but then I had a \nsandwhich and calmed down.</span></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I managed to get a warm rotiboy coffee bun, but there wasn&#39;t a great\nselection of food. We ended up at a cafe outside the check in &amp; departures\narea and stayed there for quite a while. When check in opened, we made our\nway through (with the somewhat standard visa faff along the way). Our gate was\n6A, so we sat down at gate 6 and waited, listening to the many gate changes\n(&quot;due to an aircraft parking change, flight X has been moved to gate Y&quot;) which\nseemed to occur for most flights. We didn&#39;t realise that gate 6A was located\n<strong>underneath</strong> gate 6, not beside it like all the other gates ...

After our nap, we met Marianne at a\ncafe close by for some great food (Rosie&#39;s been missing bread in particular)\nand caught up.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Guys, bread is just delicious, especially good bread, I mean\nwe&#39;re not talking sliced white bread here, this was good bread.</span>\nAfter eating, we decided to see the city centre sights, so took\nthe train to Circular Quay. There, we took in the sites of the Harbour Bridge,\nthe Opera House and the massive cruise ship moored between them. We walked\naround, finishing at the Opera House where we said goodbye to Marianne and\nwent into the botanical gardens.</p>\n\n<p>We spent a while in the botanics, walking around the succulent garden and\nusing the free garden wifi. I had a carrot cake at the cafe and we sat on the\ngrass outside for a while as Rosie wasn&#39;t feeling that great.

Unfortunately, there didn&#39;t seem to be that many\ndecent-looking places to eat there, so we got the train back to Redfern,\nseeing the sunset from the Harbour Bridge.</p>\n\n<p>It turned out that not that many places were open and those that were open\nwere just as expensive as where we had been. I guess we were a little too used\nto cheap South East Asian prices. We ended up at a slightly upmarket\nFrench-inspired place with a set two-course meal. Rosie got a starter and I\ngot a dessert (creme brulee) and for once we got the same main (gorgonzola\ngnocchi - we&#39;ve been missing cheese) due to he reduced meal selection.

We also\ngot shouted at by a guy on the street and realised that since leaving the UK\nwe haven&#39;t really seen any public drunkenness until now. We stopped at an\nunnecessarily air-conditioned Spar to get some bread, butter and bananas for\nbreakfasts. I also got a Dairy Milk - unsurprisingly, not as good as the UK\nversion, never mind Irish, but a chunk is still good when shaved into a toasted\nbanana sandwich.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Australia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zkHdzvuHT5QNBXLIUc1DKvxwQ2SXPsuojqgTMrmcwIkx0LLIiyT39WvAmLZbp0MlPvgeHIwmeB87NQL_Z40PVSj9dh8PsEu-72hRrYongDj64_x4Pej_IvrBfMf9Jn0sfmiEPKzDNow=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Sydney opera house","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PySo64WZfT04wuTo5YweXupLxFbfgq-pEEEHb8XvagXgkoPFilByK0I7vDTpGWoA8LHD055P4lAUQSZvOC7wClEyNfgV7jJl3zAIQE16Qq91iaY1mi9NEqYSf_HuXEcKtzAU-qcIVQg=w2400","width":2400,"height":1803,"aspectRatio":1.3311148086522462,"caption":"She was a pretty good tour guide","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ubUpgqGjeImlELNa0D4ohmlK_baC5SaLx7wwjzbiae7X3a5nrg9KIQvA4qVutf4yh7PCv-XeRwBnjjkVKHZJ_aL7fs770FNsH-L8NpMTn2EP2jhsSCoOgukTEqR2im47m-yqOfTfkfE=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"Harbour bridge","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8-IX8iTqw_5XgDg1ZVP9RbVd1lGoYX3mB25-F0QjO9KfG266DSuVnJFEl_riWv3H5D27AGglOAW9iedmlD0CD3I-B8Oh7XxSTr4HuoKMp10HPoffCdq7VyJSc3uYmioW2DbsfUD469k=w2400","width":2400,"height":4267,"aspectRatio":0.5624560581204593,"caption":"Oh hello Mr.kookaburra","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":83,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Gili","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":85,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Sydney","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>85, \"previous\"=>84, \"next\"=>86}":{"data":{"day":{"number":85,"date":"2018-03-29","post":{"content":"<p>Despite a lie in until 9.30am, we were both a bit groggy, probably due to Bali\nbeing three hours behind Sydney.

As we walked past all the little beaches it\nwas very reminiscent of Southern California, especially with all the free\nwater fountains in the parks.</p>\n\n<p>Another similarity was the food. We&#39;d looked up Australian food and found that\na lot of &quot;Australian&quot; food seems to be from other places, maybe with a new\nname (sausages are &quot;snags&quot;, a mille feuille is a &quot;vanilla slice&quot;, spag bol is\nthe same and all are quintessentially Australian apparently).

We got another bus to the next ferry stop that still had ferries\nrunning to catch one to the centre.</p>\n\n<p>Like London&#39;s Oyster card system, you can get prepaid Opal cards here to pay\nfor trains, buses and ferries.

The\nferry was large, comfortable and had free wifi. It was slightly delayed as it\nhad to maneuvre around the huge cruise ship that was leaving, but we had time.</p>\n\n<p>We parted ways with Marianne at Circle Quay and searched out one of Sydney&#39;s\nchocolate cafes after her recommendation. We found a Lindt cafe geared up for\nEaster, complete with Lindor pick and mix of quite a few weird flavours. I had\na Lindt chocolate lava cake with white chocolate ice cream, but held back from\nindulging too much. Next time.</p>\n\n<p>We went back to Circle Quay for sunset and saw the light show projected onto\npart of the Opera House at about 7.30pm.

We\nwalked down a pretty packed path to three huge rock pillars called the three\nsisters. As we did so, the cloud lifted a little, giving us stunning views\nacross the forest hundreds of metres below. The path was thin, the tourists\nwere plentiful and the drops were pretty sharp, but the handrails were good.</p>\n\n<p>Back up at the viewpoint we got a much better look at the landscape which was\nbreathtaking. We took another path and very quickly got away from the bustle\nof the viewpoint, but with multiple points with possibly better views.

Slightly more places were open today than yesterday,\nbut a lot were closed - it feels kind of like Ireland. We all got pizza and\nsebago and sweet potato chips without really knowing what sebago was - turns\nout it&#39;s a popular variety of potato here (which made great chips / roasties).</p>\n\n<p>Back at our Airbnb, I phoned home, which is a little more awkward here due to\nthe time difference. We&#39;re here during one of the few weeks a year that it&#39;s\nten hours between the UK and Sydney - due to the two daylight savings&#39; times,\nlast week it was a difference of eleven hours, tomorrow it will be a\ndifference of nine hours.

Plus the\napp is cool.</span></p>\n\n<p>We then went on a walking tour which was great. It was focused on the cultural side of Buenos\nAires rather than the political and historical side. That being said, it\nstarted at a statue of San Martin, the liberator of Argentina (and close to\nhalf of the rest of South America). Our guide pointed out that people from\nBuenos Aires (porteños) are prone to exaggeration, of which the statue is an\nexample. The horse has two legs off the ground, which should apparently mean\nthat the person died in battle, but San Martin did not.</p>\n\n<p>Next to the park with this statue were two very different monuments to\nArgentina&#39;s relationship with the UK. The first is &quot;pequeño Big Ben&quot;, a clock\ntower given as a gift from the UK to Argentina in honour of the centenary of\nits independence (it&#39;s very different in style from Big Ben). Nearby and\nfacing it is the Malvinas (Falkland Island) War memorial. It had fresh flowers\nand apparently normally has two guards, but possibly they had the day off.\nYesterday was a public holiday commemorating the war, which seems to be fresh\nin everyone&#39;s minds - they&#39;re taught in school that the Malvinas are part of\nArgentina (along with a fair hunk of Antartica) and Malvinas veterans get\nreduced fares on public transport.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I&#39;m not sure at what point argentinian\nadults learn that the Malvinas are not argentinian, our guide spoke as thought\nit was common knowledge but if they learn it in school, at what point are they\nnotified of the truth.</span></p>\n\n<p>Our guide (and quite a few people we&#39;ve met since) talked quite a lot about\nthe &quot;golden age&quot; of Argentina, roughly from the 1880s to the 1930s or 1940s.\nDuring this time, Argentina exported a lot of beef (their main export now is\nsoya to feed other people&#39;s beef catle herds) and encouraged immigration from\nEurope. A small number of families owned a lot of the land and became very\nwealthy. They toured Europe frequently and that influence can be seen in the\nmany French-style palacios dotted about the city. We saw eight on the tour and\nin total there are close to 40 left standing of the original 108. Most of the\nmaterials for the buildings came from Europe along with their architects.</p>\n\n<p>Buenos Aires definitely seems wealthy compared to South East Asia, but also\nquite focused on how good things used to be. Admittedly, given some of their\nhigh import taxes and high inflation rate (apparently 50% two years ago and\n25% last year), I can kind of see why. It feels pretty European, or maybe\nAmerican due to the grid system of the roads. Almost all the streets are one\nway or very, very wide, but many people have told us to beware of the crazy\ndrivers. We haven&#39;t seen any evidence of this to speak of - definitely not\ncompared to South East Asia. People pay attention to traffic lights here, if\nnot stop signs, and one way does mean one way, not just one way for cars, two\nways for motorbikes.</p>\n\n<p>We had a bit of a wait after the tour until dinner because restaurants don&#39;t\nopen until 7.30pm - 8.30pm here.

We&#39;ve been trying to follow a basic\nexercise regime for the last few weeks and so did so today in an outdoor gym.</p>\n\n<p>Our guide had recommended a place nearby for empanadas (small pasties that are\nextremely popular here), so we shared four, all with different fillings. I had\nanother local delicacy for dessert: an alfajor, basically two crumbly biscuits\njoined by a layer of dulce de leche.

The military overthrew her husband&#39;s government and outlawed\nPeronism, making it a crime even to speak his or her name. After more than a\ndecade, it turned out that the military government had buried her in Italy.\nHer body was returned to her husband, then in Spain with his third wife, who\napparently displayed the body in his dining room near the table.

Our plan had been to take the train north to the river delta at\nTigre, which is supposed to be picturesque. However, while it was cheap to get\nthere, it didn&#39;t look like it would be as cheap to do some kayaking as we had\nhoped. We&#39;d probably just end up sitting on a boat and going to ok museums, so\nwe decided to just stay in BA centre.</p>\n\n<p>We took the opportunity to go on the walking tour we&#39;d missed yesterday, and\nI&#39;m glad we managed to go on it. We had a different guide, but the three other\ntourists who&#39;d been on our other tour happened to be there too, along with a\nDanish couple and an English/French guy.</p>\n\n<p>The tour focused more on the politics and history of Buenos Aires, starting at\nthe congress building, which is very similar to the US Capitol Building. Our\nguide told us a bit more about the structure of Buenos Aires and how it is\nbased around the avenue Rivadavia beside congress. This avenue runs east to\nwest through the entire city. Many north to south roads cross it and change\nnames as they do so. On these north to south streets, addresses are given by\nthe number of metres to Rivadavia and each block is 100 metres, making it\npretty easy to work out how far you are from other places. In addition, the\nsquare outside congress contains a large white stone with &quot;0km&quot; on it which is\nthe exact location used throughout Argentina to calculate distances to Buenos\nAires.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The whole city feels like it was drawn on graph paper by someone\nwith a very long ruler.</span></p>\n\n<p>As we walked on, our guide pointed out some of the older buildings, built\nduring the golden era of Buenos Aires when it saw itself as &quot;the Paris of\nSouth America&quot;. One of the most interesting was heavily influenced by Dante&#39;s\ndivine comedy and had been the largest building in South America at 100m when\nit was built, one metre for each canto of the Divine Comedy. Apparently it had\nbeen built by two Italian immigrants who, during WWI, were afraid that Europe\nwould no longer be a safe resting place for Dante&#39;s ashes and wanted to build\n a sanctuary for them. The ashes was never moved, but the building has many\n designs inspired by the book, eg the basement and ground floor represent Hell\n with nine archways and monstrous statues. The middle floors represent\n Purgatory while the top few floors represent Heaven, with a lighthouse and\n balconies reminiscent of clouds.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of our tour we headed back to the Pink House and saw several\nprotests for various things - according to our guide, they have an average of\ntwenty a week. Later in the day we saw the most common demonstration - a march\nin rememberance of the 30,000 people who disappeared during the last military\ndictatorship in the 1970s and the women who stood up to it. As part of this,\nquite a few of the people who disappeared were pregnant women, so around 400\nchildren are believed to have been born to mothers held by the regime, then\nhidden with new names in other families. There has been a long running\ncampaign to try and reunite the now-grown children with their biological\nfamilies and our guide said that the 127th missing child had been reunited\nonly two months ago.</p>\n\n<p>As we got closer to the Pink House, the English/French guy in our group kind\nof slumped and said he was fainting. We gave him some water (that vanilla coke\nbottle has served us well) and others gave him some coke and he perked up. He\njust hadn&#39;t had enough to drink, which is understandable as it wasn&#39;t hot\nenough that you&#39;d immediately think to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Our tour ended by the obelisk erected in 1936 to commemorate 400 years since\nthe founding of the city. Our guide showed us some of the hand gestures used\nby people here and told us what they mean (eg ways to order different\ncoffees), many with similarities to Italian gestures, but slightly different\nmeanings.</p>\n\n<p>We had some decent pizza at a place recommended by our guide and some ice\ncream near by (another food that&#39;s supposed to be good here, and it was). We\nhad a look around the city cathedral, which used to be the cathedral of the\ncurrent Pope. It&#39;s a bit smaller and more understated than many of the\nEuropean cathedrals I&#39;ve seen.</p>\n\n<p>We headed back to the hotel, mainly to try and find my hat. Rosie had had the\ngreat idea to WhatsApp the Uber driver that had brought us from the airport\nand sure enough, she had the hat. Rosie communicated with her throughout the\nday, wifi dependent and with good use of Google Translate. The hotel was the\neasiest place for us to meet, so we went back to wait and have a look at\nthings to do in the coming few days.</p>\n\n<p>We went to a slightly fancier Italian restaurant for dinner and had some more\ngood bread, pasta and wine. A little after we got back to the hotel, the Uber\ndriver arrived with my hat in tow - Rosie saved the day.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Guys, words can&#39;t\nquite communicate how excited Daniel was to be reunited with his hat.</span></p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Argentina","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8OMgRW_7vkQFi4xq8-YEzHiS-io2-60JJvcjhoqDGJzFulBPzUBu_WriWRNyT78RXUEfzMKOC_VASgLzLZhpRCVX3Pfx6eVLN3xmrILDFRKN1QXw5cgRHj8R_H3DJuIqtnDewNY2j4U=w2400","width":2400,"height":1768,"aspectRatio":1.3574660633484164,"caption":"The congress building","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oQ0AvZ7aN8avXPZWy-rEVcH3VGQQM-vUv_ltF5pxPXTM2nbxsBuetk5eJdIUKCARijiiowxd323TVBQSO3YIk9QWviVyRCp9wQhIVg-5GZGACNq85qPgbLhU2LGFiLFX0WhlXntWP5I=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"Mural of Evita giving a speech.

As planned, we used the morning to go La Boca, but\nmaybe didn&#39;t see as much as we would have on a sunny afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>La Boca (literally &quot;the mouth&quot;) was the first port area of Buenos Aires and is\napparently a bit dodgy, but has a small, popular, touristy area (aside - I&#39;ve\nheard a lot of people using &quot;touristic&quot; rather than &quot;touristy&quot; - I didn&#39;t\nrealise that was a word, so it&#39;s always a bit jarring). In that area there&#39;s\na big blue and yellow football stadium, probably the national passtime, and\na short street lined with buildings painted bright blues, greens, reds and\nyellows as if it had been built out of Lego. Various blogs and guidebooks\nsaid that it can be crowded and there are groups of people dancing tango in\nthe street, but I guess the insistent rain put paid to that today.</p>\n\n<p>Getting steadily more wet, we didn&#39;t stay long. We caught the bus a few stops\nup the road, hen walked through another protest to the National History\nMuseum. It was focused primarily on independence, but with bits of other\nperiods of history dotted in here and there. We were given a booklet that had\nenglish translations of <strong>most</strong> of the explanations throughout the galleries\nand made our way through. It was very interesting, but somewhat confusing,\npartly due to ocassional difficulties and translations and that the exhibits\nweren&#39;t necessarily chronological. The particularly intriguing bit was how the\nmuseum identified its own historical significance - it was set up in the late\n1800s as Argentina was trying to forge a single national spirit while also\nencouraging immigration from Europe. Reading between the lines, the museum\nclose to deified the figures of the independence movement to inspire unity\nthrough patriotism, but has since toned this down a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards we collected our bags from our hotel and, having checked out\nearlier in the morning, got an Uber (which may have been ordered to stop\noperating here ...) out from the centre to a cooking class. This was held in\nour teacher&#39;s house. Saul was an ex-economist who had decided he enjoyed\nteaching people to cook more than his day job. He had a decent kitchen and I&#39;d\nliked the look of the menu we would cook.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> He was very lovely and personable,\nit kind of felt like being taught how to cook by your uncle.</span></p>\n\n<p>He greeted us with a few snacks - olives, cheese, salami and some of his own\nsourghdough. He&#39;d prepared quite a few of the ingredients for our dishes\nbeforehand, so the class was a mix of demonstration and hands-on learning,\nbut I learnt a lot.</p>\n\n<p>We started with a rum and dulce de leche semifredo. He whipped the cream, then\nadded in a cap of rum per person and the dulce de leche. We scooped the\nmixture into glasses and left it to chill during the rest of the class. They\nwere great, surprisingly not too sweet, but maybe a little too rummy.</p>\n\n<p>Most of what we did was make empanadas. Saul had a light recipe for pastry\nmade with more water than lard and a bit of baking powder to make it a bit\nflaky. The pastry was easy to work and needed a bit of kneading, which was\nstrange to me seeing most pastry I&#39;ve made has required trying to reduce the\namount of time you touch it with warm hands. We left the pastry in the fridge\nwhile we made the filling.</p>\n\n<p>Saul had already chopped up the ingredients, so I sauted the onions while he\ndescribed the spices and the roughly minced beef we were using. Once the sauce\nwas done it went into the fridge, too, but Saul said normally he would leave\nit to sit to slowly cool for an hour before doing so.</p>\n\n<p>We then made circles of pastry by working togetjer to roll the pastry out\nusing a pasta roller. Saul showed us the versatility of the pastry by covering\nsome of the leftovers in salt and backing to create little crackers and dry\nfrying a couple of the circles to create simple tortillas that were\nsurprisingly good.</p>\n\n<p>We then made empanadas by putting a dollop of filling on a pastry circle in\nour left hand, forming the filling into a denser &quot;mountain&quot;, then slowly\njoining together the sides of the empanada, tilting our left hands and working\nfrom the bottom up. We then formed a particular crimp that apparently\nindicates that there is beef in the empanada. I wasn&#39;t particularly good and\nonly really got worse as we went on. We egg washed most of them, but left six\nplain. Once baked, they were pretty good and I actually preferred the non\negg washed ones.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> One day I will manage a perfect crimp on a pasty or empanada\nbut today was not that day.</span></p>\n\n<p>The main course that we made was the classic Argentinian steak. Like most\nsteak seems to be here, it was huge - about 700g for the three of us (we\ndidn&#39;t finish it). Saul covered it in <strong>a lot</strong> of salt and seared it for a\nfew minutes on each side. He put it into a dish and covered it with some of\nthe juices from the pan and chimmichurri, then roasted it for 17 minutes on\neach side (20 minutes per pound, apparently).<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It was lovely but there was\njust way way to much steak, I really struggled to finish my piece. I don&#39;t know\nhow the argentinians eat so much meat.</span></p>\n\n<p>Saul had prepared the chimmichurri beforehand, but gave us the recipe. It is a\ntraditional sauce which we realised we&#39;d had the previous night and enjoyed.\nSaul told us that the name &quot;chimmichurri&quot; is strange even here. There is a\nstory that it comes from British men a few hundred years ago seeing gauchos\n(Argentinian cowboys) preparing it, then saying &quot;give me curry&quot;, which has\nbeen corrupted over the years.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> This was probably my favourite part of the\nmeal, I reckon you could put chimmichurri on just about anything.</span></p>\n\n<p>Saul accompanied us to the train station to get back to the centre. We had a\nbus to catch, but plenty of time. Or at least, we thought so, until our train\nrepeatedly stopped for much longer than we were supposed to. Eventually\narriving at the station, we partly walked, partly ran to the bus station, only\nto find that the organisation was a bit of a shambles - a sign said we needed\nstand 43, but someone official looking there said he didn&#39;t know where the bus\nwas supposed to be. We found the sales desk for our company, who told us it\nwould arrive between stands 14 to 25 ...</p>\n\n<p>We made it onto the bus - which we were to be on for the next 15 hours. Our\nseats were very comfortable with tables that could be erected above them.\nUnfortunately they didn&#39;t recline all the way down into a bed as I thought\nthey were supposed to.</p>\n\n<p>There was the end of a film (Arrival) playing in quiet English with Spanish\nsubtitles. We watched until the end, then another film started (Before I\nfall). It was on just enough that we wanted to know how it ended, but then it\nwas replaced with music stopped for dinner, which we ate some of, and then a\ngame of bingo, considerably harder in Spanish. Rosie went to sleep when\nanother bad film came on and I tried with little success to write a few diary\nentries, then got some sleep.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Argentina","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PJkqCEYXd1NPDkJLQg4Ul_YurHjTwUqkp-ZJ9Cn44EZx7zIox0BKF56tfmhedQamQBlds-cIMif_obEknqbT_P2f_Spd75v_M9iuhugEA8I9rthzfFeRidwEBdkayHdpvINwRUu4fTw=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"Murals in La Boca","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EBwXQ1RJsesDBtPBo14GXkUwHpa_fbtYNTq0u-Y2YSHPwOTBu1cPa7ufVl4DWSr_CGHMBZ4VF9lipJWfLbx1SzsAWXNIEgaz6irdSR0vZjAyvv27-EpcG4M-j9ntNqarz54NAxPLxpM=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"The colours of La Boca","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dpT6j9fcP_uVUV93RNrMuAOSl8bDID6Udbcy2qE9VTJAYxf2TgctgFu-FM8EGdJ-ciMteFxE-YxwF3gJR0ik5LxKZsEVBBCXL35-OXo-XjhPcwapg9u1JdJbTrDXSYCuvw77Hd2lXd8=w2400","width":2400,"height":4267,"aspectRatio":0.5624560581204593,"caption":"Our empanadas","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3NW9tX-amzpZtrWOpihKsso5J-RKCOG9niW59hipmW5KewfaQEMiFOg6kDDsmh22vrvvxLeyhzu8bFnN9xGelhW5qT2joPuXnEh8EciGUHk1_txp7ffB3fEogjm9ypsVTkAWfIIkYfU=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"Steak and potatoes with chimmichurri sauce!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/glFJPJP5vlU9TQSd3DsbZLnpTPtgxHciinJ5yWExsvLaZd0wKCiIxrcZo8tzFiHKjdQRtuNxwYLN3U9UBsGg0ftW1HDabkLf_nN0Tdr1lc59LT-lz8w3TXcUOCMS144obd1Jux2l7R0=w2400","width":2400,"height":4267,"aspectRatio":0.5624560581204593,"caption":"semifredo","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":92,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Buenos Aires","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":94,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Mendoza","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>94, \"previous\"=>93, \"next\"=>95}":{"data":{"day":{"number":94,"date":"2018-04-07","post":{"content":"<p>Still a bit tired after our bus sleep, we arrived in Mendoza in the mid\nmorning.

They turned out to work for Disney as salespeople and event\nmanagers in Argentina for events to promote the opening of a new part of\nDisneyworld. It turned out there was another guy on our tour, close to passed\nout on the back seat, having been out last night and not having slept.</p>\n\n<p>Our first bodega (a winery here) was picturesque, surrounded by vines and\nwithin sight of the snow-capped Andes. It is owned by a French family who had\nmade wine in southern France, then sold their vineyards to buy land here. A\nguide from the bodega showed us the resevoir that fed the irrigation for the\nvines, then led us into the winery itself. She showed us the steel tanks,\nconcrete tanks and French oak casks used to ferment the wine (cheaper wines in\nsteel or concrete, more expensive in oak). She then took us below to the\nbasement to see the oak barrels that the wines were aged in (the more\nexpensive the wine, the longer the time it spends in barrels and the newer the\nbarrels). Finally, she showed us the bottled wine, stored standing up if\nclosed with a fake cork or screw cap, stored lying down if corked (so that the\ncork doesn&#39;t dry out, shrink and let in some air).<span  class=\"Rosie\"> My favourite part was\nwatching them mix the wine by pumping the liquid from the bottom of the tank\nthrough a massive sieve in a bathtub and then pumping it up over the top of\nthe tank. This causes the grape solids to mix with the liquid as apparently\nthey float after a while.</span></p>\n\n<p>Our tasting was also in the basement. We had one white and three reds, not too\nmuch, but I could feel it by the end. We learnt that you should be able to\ntell a Malbec solely by its colour (slightly violet at the edges rather than\nred) and that Chardonnay is often disliked by people who dislike bananas.</p>\n\n<p>We had about a 30 minute drive to the next winery and learnt that our guide,\nAlecio, had only been at the company for a week and a half. He seems to have\nhad loads of other jobs though, despite being 24, and spent a year travelling\nthrough South America.</p>\n\n<p>Our second winery was actually the owners&#39; house, with the wine production\nin a huge room off the side of the house and the wine stored in the cellar.\nThe building was impressive, open and airy with lots of mirrors and local art\n(including a picture of Mickey Mouse that the Disney guys loved). It was\ncloser to the Andes and our tasting was outside with a stunning view.</p>\n\n<p>Our third winery was even closer to the Andes. Apparently the work of the same\narchitect as the previous one, but much larger. This was less of a tour as it\nwas primarily a six course lunch with wine pairings. I don&#39;t remember as much\nabout the wines here as I was more focused on the food and the conversation\n(now significantly loosened by the wine). The food was decent, the steak was\nlarge but not obscene and the raspberry &quot;foam&quot; (ice cream) was delicious.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll admit I fell asleep for about an hour of the two-hour drive home - I\nthink only Rosie, Alecio and the driver remained awake for the whole time.

Rosie had found. We had our hostel breakfast and I tried\nto use up some not-so-nice South American Dairy Milk (made in Uruguay, I\nthink) by putting it in porridge. I really don&#39;t recommend that - stirring it\nin a bit just accentuated the nastier tastes in the chocolate, not its\ncreaminess. However, the bits that weren&#39;t stirred in were pockets of melted\nchocolate, which was decent.</p>\n\n<p>Rosie got a travel card from the hostel which we then topped up with money so\nthat we could get some buses - they don&#39;t take cash. After some discussion, we\ngot some crackers, a soft cheese and a packet of cookies for lunch, then\ncaught the bus to the foothills of the Andes.</p>\n\n<p>We followed a gravel track up a mountain which stayed pretty flat for a long\nwhile then became steep. The mountain is definitely a foothill - only 1675m\nand we probably started at 1000m or higher. Still, it was pretty steep and the\nground in front where Mendoza is built is very flat, so the view was great,\nespecially with the Andes behind it. Until we saw it from there, neither of us\nhad really appreciated how big Mendoza is.</p>\n\n<p>There wasn&#39;t too much in the way of wildlife, this being essentially a desert.\nWe saw several large birds and I almost stepped on a tiny snake right at the\nstart, but otherwise saw very little.</p>\n\n<p>We caught the bus back and got off near(ish) the big San Martin park to climb\nthe smaller hill there. We had a decent view of the mountain we climbed with\nthe Andes in the background (but into the sun, so the photos probably aren&#39;t\ngreat). We spent a bit of time at the independence memorial at the top, then\nwalked back into town.</p>\n\n<p>It was between 6pm and 7pm at this point and I was pretty hungry, but\ntypically people don&#39;t eat here until after 8.30pm - 9pm. However, we came\nacross a restaurant (another Italian place) offering 40% off before 8.30pm,\nso they definitely wanted us to eat. Like everywhere else, it was starting to\nopen and was practically deserted.</p>\n\n<p>The food was fantastic - warm bread, nice oil and vinegar, incredibly juicy\nburrata and slow roasted tomatoes and rich, cheesy baked pasta dishes. Our\nwaiter was also really good, replacing our bread whenever it was done and\nhelping us find a half bottle of wine we&#39;d like. We left very full, but happy.\n<div class=\"Rosie\"> Guys the burrata was just amazing!</span></p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Argentina","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/deUCtFwzSVp5-sVOTMhI6OrVohFB3-Oz6J1Zr14aVpisjqziQ6RvKeTkHdZmWChQvgtwejNdQ43F4J0ChO90NZkx5sFzxs-zNOxrf6EWoBi-Z6Ffucz5mFBoPP7ewDttOqICOidxwqs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1803,"aspectRatio":1.3311148086522462,"caption":"We climbed a hill!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ak_gb6y2516TWGzo7-U6XMCC5x-jmXl0JJw8tI8JzcOn01SZitCMr1oHUpr8uxgMzPr71nE5xMSyG8d04yeNFSXzzcPlMv9aUgjcfdHyCF9Ljf85NOG2IfNeHJUqhgY1hA27r9urSCY=w2400","width":2400,"height":4267,"aspectRatio":0.5624560581204593,"caption":"Delicous dinner","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lchWqDeqFTPYoHVQQspMByh1VbLzWBxYa_WAuSwM-PfB2zh5NI2aUoTggwTzFUllFGJOvCiQtAiSTAHOehgTp3Um0g2ba3O-kPbtK5A8NPAJtkqRg5kfW7_YDJMvJalBqZtVePT1C-c=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Looking at the view","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zG7azmFw_1K4jUNtwLELI21cRm5iR0hUgjsABJCjNV6naP8k6USJ2pFmoTFS9E8EjLsYFu1ehaKt7yJsMAK1RxKyEnTip52_az6C2PIiD86za89YtQtJaO1KQyr0TUh3zNCsL-ewuy8=w2400","width":2399,"height":1608,"aspectRatio":1.4919154228855722,"caption":"New friend","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":95,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Mendoza","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":97,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Mendoza","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>97, \"previous\"=>96, \"next\"=>98}":{"data":{"day":{"number":97,"date":"2018-04-10","post":{"content":"<p>We visited another couple of wineries today, this time in an area called\nLuyan de Cuyo. We&#39;d both separately found recommendations to hire bikes from\nthe well named Baccus Bikes who gave us a map, recommendations for where to go\nand even booked lunch for us.</p>\n\n<p>Luyan de Cuyo is a little bit south of central Mendoza, so we needed to get a\nbus. We walked to one bus stop and immediately gave up as the road was blocked\noff for work. We walked to another stop and waited for 45 minutes before\ngiving up. The bus system here is a bit odd - all buses have a big number for\nthe rough area they&#39;re going to and a small number for the exact route. This\nmeans that from a distance many buses look like your bus, but end up not being\nso. After two or three buses hadn&#39;t shown up that were supposed to, we walked\nto the next bus stop and finally caught one.</p>\n\n<p>After picking up our somewhat expensive bikes, we headed to the first\nrecommendation - Carmelo Patti&#39;s winery. Apparently, Carmelo Patti is a\nstalwart of the wine scene here and he had the newspaper cutouts to display\nreviews of him and his wine from across the world. His place was quite\ndifferent to all the others we&#39;d been to. It wasn&#39;t at a vineyard (although I\nthink he has at least one), but at a warehouse where he stores the bottles. He\nalso buys other people&#39;s grapes and creates blends there, too. In addition, at\nmost of the places we&#39;ve been so far the wine has at most a year in the bottle\nbefore it is sold. Carmelo stores his for four to eight years so that people\nwho buy it don&#39;t have to do so in their own wine cellars (according to him).</p>\n\n<p>We had a quick tour with three others who had also rented bikes from Baccus.\nCarmelo only speaks Spanish, so it was a bit of a test, but we got most of it.\nHe showed us that he stores the bottles in cardboard boxes and keeps the\nbottles upside down so that the cork doesn&#39;t dry out and the wine doesn&#39;t\noxidise. He told us that if we buy wine and plan on keeping it for more than a\nfew months, we should take off the wrapper around the neck to inspect the\ncork. If there is obvious discolouration in a line down the height of the\ncork, the wine will oxidise and should be drunk soon. Otherwise, the wine can\nbe stored for twenty years on its side (out of light).</p>\n\n<p>We tasted three of his wines, giving him a chance to give us another tip.\nApparently it can be hard to open older bottles of wine, but if you warn the\nneck of the bottle with a lighter, the cork should become easier to remove.\nThe wines we tasted were a Malbec which had been bottled four years ago, a\nCabernet Sauvignon bottled eight years ago and a blend of Malbec, Cabernet\nSav, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. They were all quite nice, but the wines I&#39;ve\nliked most so far were all younger.</p>\n\n<p>His place was really busy, with people there before and after us. He seemed to\nreally enjoy teaching people about wine and in having so many guests from all\nover the world - he was particularly proud of his eleven large guest books\nwhere everyone wrote something after their visit. There was no charge for our\nvisit, either, and not even a sign outside his property saying where it was.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&#39;t have far to the next winery and went with the three women we&#39;d had\nthe tour with. I could very slightly feel the wine, but we cycled on the hard\nshoulder most of the way.</p>\n\n<p>This winery, Lagarde, came highly recommended by Bridget who had been here a\nfew months ago. It&#39;s one of the older vineyards at around 110 year old. We had\nmissed the scheduled our but it was also the place we had booked lunch. Like a\nfew days ago, lunch was a six course menu with paired wines (a Viogner,\nChardonnay, Merlot, Malbec, and a sparkling blend). The food was delicious and\ninventive, but would be difficult to replicate. Two of the starters contained\nice cream - one basil, the other red pepper. The steak portion in the main\ncourse was absolutely massive, I couldn&#39;t quite finish it. Luckily, there was\nspace in the pudding stomach for the peach tart and almond praline that\nfollowed.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout our meal, there was a group of people at a nearby table who had\nappeared with their own photographer and videographer. It was a bit weird\nseeing how much of their meal was split up with posing for one or the other,\nbut we never really worked out who they were or what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>After our meal, despite not finishing most of my (generous) tasting glasses, I\ncould feel the wine. We spent quite a long time wandering through the\nvineyards and gardens where some of the veg we&#39;d eaten had been grown. We saw\nplenty of olive trees dotted among the vines and flocks of birds flew between\nthem. We saw some of the irrigation channels being filled to water lines of\nvines.</p>\n\n<p>After a good while, we cycled to our last stop, a little shop called A La\nAntigua selling homemade preserves, savoury spreads and liqueurs. They also\nlet us taste many of these - including a few olive spreads, a raspberry\nvinegar and some flavoured dulce de leches. We wanted to buy something, but\napparently the border crossing to Chile is very strict. Instead, we gave them\na little bit of money.</p>\n\n<p>We left back the bikes and caught a bus back to Mendoza. Completely stuffed,\nwe did not need dinner. We spent the evening searching for a pinguino in a\nfew tourist shops. Literally meaning &quot;penguin&quot;, pinguinos are ceramic penguins\nused to hold and pour wine which we&#39;d seen in Buenos Aires and Rosie was\nendeared with. We found what we were looking for and went back to the hostel.\nI finally added the diary entries from Australia to the site and ended up\ngoing to sleep pretty late (around 1am).</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Argentina","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MCfLkEFuqS7tBtDF8QKrcm4-2mIqDRrAT6nDxJ2POP7Z6FWYBmlkZHP6XdxgtXo4rzuksDjWJ1y1vElNbtSy2yJoFTARzEOkset4i03peXjjoJWMmKDdO2tVzQwkxMqkt6S3iR9_a1M=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"The first course","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rfMDP7QWOyoLmxWy7vjWVgprp1FdzKqWzLQPoFTcMeZoJ_sz8AS0Cj_f2-Zy8juuWGVZ6kt5DWJRY0lzW59yY00xooQ9mK3NRnuWJyoFrfDSJO1ax91YiBHLLja6T4dzm-tKnP3k69s=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"The third course","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cIfhQ7B6gyb3ZiZcYZ4jMMsX8ETZ6z9szONNVyJmfVVS8IpO1kQOt52_2nxymBQMk4Jz9WUPkKQYQHl1xVjrMwxcrezqQhezXDSnvUv1QCTFXbI6aSyaO6enwFO3ajGeShVeBbB_zaY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"They do like their steak here","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mpbNOoaTOb7C0b7k5Q5CiRboNmF-lEWjqIIUo3liu40ktGdaPtUpaxT4tYkCPCWTw0c9dTlVhOBBHZjoZbNsxCXjGOyhPJDNCSVndQ3T3dZ3tBs3rIlFGpb_ZJhZz5EF3DrGrbIQhU0=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"The wines!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vu2KWBBC9DGff7Cxyn9pPjxxIx9Enn2m53HhdlTzJza3Vc8CbQT_ZClQyM6UmqbvLdyvHwxP97HaeQ7nzw9TeJbXutlbgKF7uCpycWBBcknIsFGpsO26FDFRViNlQvDqBZc9djOjoo8=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"The pudding","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MwjmWcLINb-gWgWhC_xsZBGuLwrmYeMBy1D8W7ku1_42JNpTvjK3wzaytkJVmHK57bpGCZMUmrkEWrhnhnyvCIM94IWsUHTS7WCBJwgejD51x48MlQ_rgFQgftWYWlPClgZ705cX9sE=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"Lagarde fermenting barrels","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R1sXp2HsQ3ULSPhMClzQmuBOOP-ROSJdJkyEvZLx1aHh_G1D2dPLlrXTbkS-u2SLGcW-1g3LJR9kFqed1ChFGVAkd6tPBkyfxDIxDeTn43rZYbSDZ8FeEtUxMfDOEbbrpHY8DvgOsko=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Dan and the vines","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5jaoVht0QJyZ5LbOGwxTLOIXD_fFiR4rMXWQAS1qYFywBDWsCANKbluuYSbKv3An5WV0yj7KJHLHf-eVZZxXvCCOLr5ahm5iuXNhtbQU0RRxc8joy2cO1QC2qQ6PI8LuAPdhEhpXeJs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Here are some grapes","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0UufHdGj0GHefwKL4M6BYmSzNSk6ywBUWsulw5CUMbbGj_KOT_18Va4GWi9OhXKJdFcD7Ik7ePByuMPoWM1rj9lLX4a0ggn2wccW_a_ORKfCLSazosmlr6iUq5nYp7S1pwoiydZHyOQ=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"The grapes of Lagarde","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G2Wv1kfccM09FReP6Dw6FhNPQDzjAa6hne0AuwIzrtsZFpvyJgcLbBvuTvCeTAwauee_IBkxCTjBRq9MlNmXvD7lsw3lNsMuolEIZerJqVtAW7XiE4Y0x4N032xjV8UjW0mAwseAW-A=w2400","width":2400,"height":2400,"aspectRatio":1.0,"caption":"This was a fantastic day","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":96,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Mendoza","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":98,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Mendoza","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>98, \"previous\"=>97, \"next\"=>99}":{"data":{"day":{"number":98,"date":"2018-04-11","post":{"content":"<p>The plan today orignally had been to go for a longer hike to a mountain near\nwhere we&#39;d been two days ago.

I was further\nbehind with the diary than I&#39;d ever been and, while I had added stuff to the\nsite yesterday, I&#39;d left a bit of a mess in the Git history, so adding in the\nnext set of diary entries was going to be a pain.</p>\n\n<p>We whiled away the day, writing and reading our books. We&#39;d bought lunch\nyesterday, so had that. I tried again to improve the bar Dairy Milk I had by\nmelting it and dipping a banana into it (good, but still not great). We also\nbooked the flights for the end of our trip - from Quito to San Diego on the\n7th of June (with a nice 11 hour layover in Fort Lauderdale, can&#39;t wait), and\njust for me, from San Diego to Belfast just over a week later. We must have\nhit the sweet spot for booking flights - a Wednesday a couple of months\nbeforehand - because my flight at least was quite a bit less than the last\ntime I&#39;d looked (just under £300).

The bus was at 10.30am, with only a little hassle and an\nenforced tip to the baggage handler, we pretty much left on time.</p>\n\n<p>We had the front seats on the top deck of the bus. The front window had a kind\nof netting on it to reduce the glare, but slightly spoiling the view,\nespecially through a camera. There was also a message board and TV directly\nabove us (which played Spanish-dubbed movies throughout our journey). The side\nwindow, however, was unfettered and had a decent view.</p>\n\n<p>The scenery was immense. Sharp mountains for hours on end, some snow capped,\nbut little vegetation and a crystal-clear sky. The road was decent with\nseveral long, and occasionaly poorly lit, tunnels.</p>\n\n<p>We had a border crossing into Chile in the middle of the journey, which I&#39;d\nread could be arduous, take several hours and include strict bag checks. It\nonly took about half an hour - everyone piling off the bus to get their\npassports checked, given a piece of paper, then back to the bus to grab\nluggage, hand in a customs form and put the bags through an xray, then back to\nthe bus. Easy.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The whole thing was so surprisingly efficient that we kept\nasking if we had done it correctly because we couldn&#39;t believe it could be that\neasy.</span></p>\n\n<p>The time flew by, particularly because we listened to the last few hours of\nA Memory of Light, the last book in The Wheel of Time series. We&#39;d both read\nit, but we started listening to it over two years ago in January 2016.</p>\n\n<p>We arrived in Chile and had a bit of a saga getting out money. The first ATMs\nwe found were inside a building that was having its glass walls cleaned, so\napparently we couldn&#39;t enter. The next one we found was broken and being\nfixed. The third wouldn&#39;t accept our cards. The fourth worked, but only after\nwe realised that, unlike any other country so far, we had to select an option\nstating that our card was foreign. Of course, after that we saw ATMs\neverywhere.</p>\n\n<p>We took the subway into the city from the bus station to get to the shared\napartment in which we have a room for the night. The man at reception wasn&#39;t\nable to get a hold of anyone for a while, so we played Heads Up on Rosie&#39;s\nphone in the lobby. It was ok with two players, but is better with more.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, a guy came down to let us into the flat - he&#39;d been in the pool.\nWe quickly got out our laundry and worked out where we could wash it in the\nbuilding, then changed and headed to the pool and jacuzzi as indicated on the\nsigns on every floor. They were open air pools on the roof and,\ndisappointingly, were cold. It&#39;s not that warm here, probably around 20\ndegrees Celsius at that point, but the view of Santiago at sunset was great\neven if we didn&#39;t go into the pool or non-functional jacuzzi. To add to the\ncool reception, the shower in the flat was at best lukewarm, too ...</p>\n\n<p>Once our washing was done, we were pretty hungry. It was between 8pm and 9pm,\nso just when people were starting to eat here. We found a decent-looking\nItalianish place, had some pasta and a pizza and Rosie had her first pisco\nsour of South America (at least, on this trip).</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Argentina","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Chile","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P1i1mXumTTRFHGs45bhRP3nB_ayrWozxk-qD7uWpABXhf-57FGnpSgEF4aLBWdDYUpRMzGT269B275DQuOYFEbhq6tpC94j0FIS1R7VqGIQY021xSAakjrysqhaowTiqEvrBuvOxIqM=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"The view from the bus","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QhNraFEWoaWZIuaqQ9DPFgXaw2TxL-yhMS9dFbhz4gCkuNkzraVU9B2d90V0BaYqGd1eAXnELzlv5xsvrtXw38vwt_gIeCItU_2s0aS9u4iZLHfDWPshWYAyMqCFzepvsghS77d7NGE=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"The windy, windy road","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w_x8rckaECRRbJ4_DWoSMuKFXGlfAa9GU_IAO3JJbE5unoPnSdiNi1FEIDbc_01PfqOtxPjcCGiSDEmb5ZwA-Lwp0oW27EoO8B_uB4HKIFvljhFXUqg7HuaUFgthS0sr13cgvc_2mxY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"The view from the roof","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":98,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Mendoza","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":100,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Santiago","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>100, \"previous\"=>99, \"next\"=>101}":{"data":{"day":{"number":100,"date":"2018-04-13","post":{"content":"<p>We woke up on the hundredth day of our trip to find that our host had prepared\na breakfast of yoghurt and granola. We left soon after to transfer our bags to\na hotel nearby at which we were to meet Rosie&#39;s parents, who are going to join\nus for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>As we were walking, Rosie&#39;s parents happened to spot us from their taxi, so we\nboth scrambled into the taxi for the few blocks to the hotel. Once we arrived\nwe were told that the rooms were already ready - ours had two floors with the\nbathroom and a second bed upstairs, separate from the main building.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Also\nthe chalk board in the hotel had our names on it welcoming us to the hotel. It\nwas all really very lovely.</span></p>\n\n<p>We got the metro to a large park in the museum district, putting quite a bit\nof money on a single travel card as they can be shared here. We stopped for\ncoffee and a muffin at the cafe of an art museum and Rosie and I did our\npenalty of 85 star jumps for snacking. A month or two ago we decided to force\nourselves to do star jumps whenever we snack outside mealtimes to increase the\namount of exercise we get. We started at 50 and add 5 for each additional\nsnack.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The penalty has dramatically reduced the number of snacks we eat.</span></p>\n\n<p>We spent the next hour at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, which focused\non the atrocities committed during Pinochet&#39;s regime. The museum was focused\nprimarily on the events themselves rather than the history behind it. We\nlearnt that Pinochet was one of the generals that took power in 1973, bombing\nthe President&#39;s palace where the President of the time, Allende, later\ncommitted suicide. The museum detailed the forms of torture used and where\nbodies were hidden and discovered, along with the reaction of the press, the\npeople of Chile and other countries.</p>\n\n<p>After that sobering experience, we went to the old main square of Santiago and\nhad a great Peruvian lunch (I had a chicken causa with fantasticly lemony\npotato). Apparently Peruvian food is more popular here than Chilean food.\nAfterwards, beside a large group of lined-up semiformal policemen, we joined\na walking tour in English through the city.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the tour focused on some of the more recent Chilean history,\nparticularly the Pinochet dictatorship. We stopped outside the presedential\npalace - apparently the only place the Chilean Air Force has ever bombed (we\nsaw the footage at the previous museum). Our guide was quite cautious because\nopinions are still divided in Chile. Some still see Pinochet as saving Chile\nfrom Allende&#39;s socialism and thank him for Chile&#39;s current relative wealth.\nAccording to our guide, when Pinochet eventually lost an election, he didn&#39;t\nfully leave power - he was still head of the military.</p>\n\n<p>Our tour guide was great and described quite a bit of the history, culture,\nfood and drink, savoury or otherwise. I tried a traditional drink called Mote\ncon Huesillo, a sweet drink with something like corn in it and several halves\nof dried peach. Tasty, but overly sweet. Another of the stops was at a street\nof &quot;Coffee with legs&quot; cafes - places which have female staff in short skirts\nand lots of mirrors so that male customers can appreciate their legs.\nApparently, this started as a way of trying to market coffee to men. Now there\nare much seedier establishments nearby, just hidden from sight, but are\noccasionally raided by the police.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> The girls wear even less.</span></p>\n\n<p>I met an interesting guy called Eric on the tour with us. He was travelling\nalone through South America between finishing a Law degree and starting work,\nbut also doing a distance Computer Science course on the side. He&#39;d been to\nquite a few of the places we were going to, so it was good to hear his stories\n(and to briefly talk about programming).</p>\n\n<p>We ended the tour at one of Pablo Neruda&#39;s houses. He was a famous Chilean\npoet, Nobel laureate and politician. We then went to a beer bar nearby at the\nrecommendation of our guide and tried a flight of beers (I mainly stuck to a\npisco sour).</p>\n\n<p>Getting the metro back to the hotel ended up being a lot more complicated than\nthe few stops we originally thought. After some misunderstanding, we worked\nout that during rush hour, certain trains on certain lines only stop at a\nsubset of the stations. We ended up walking a bit further after getting a red\ntrain which bypassed our green-marked station (or vice versa, I can&#39;t\nremember).</p>\n\n<p>We had a great Italian meal for dinner along with several decent wines. I\nthink (writing this weeks later) this was the first point we had the Matetic\nSauvignon Blanc, which everyone liked and was probably the wine we had the\nmost in Chile.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Chile","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Chile","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fRBamOWzGhNruCiR10vfjYIdx3qRbJKP3HnQA7QIcev0BrrEKCBi_3hkOkFaaH48FjrzsY8rcPvNL5m8xiScGqBSKaGEmCvwO-dUhB59d41YpcF5Ue2tdu6HQrdP2KhP7BJCFI_MFlM=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Look a Llama!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vU0-wDAZcfQmKK1ptWKKRgBWWFy5cgas6OBM-lLAtnElVQeQ72ol__kfzxAwtoVjR15WPbOsfUxlDEXfHX_VicvD069nzvnMYJcWFdaZ3Txk0a2FLOZQvrISZ6Mb-kY_CYpeycLpk4A=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"The presidential palace","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AHWWmHQ3dfEo8AGlF7QlOl-osezvcByio_aoBEPPRtW5MPOzBqOzvtFlLQo1EY5UO6eDmwRC-gydGyPDq6JXUynnyLARBqZc-BG5Xsphwypi9Fg51WTm4vzPGtNgY0uwgZfyLNqvBeY=w2400","width":2400,"height":4267,"aspectRatio":0.5624560581204593,"caption":"Weird corn drink which was very very sweet!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mOh4Fys0j3mEwwh2u28rQc0PclLdWWQnYufv8J7UMLsZxpq-WcP4A6spgRmdmy9DxlOOiw96up2R2nYtqhuHVvQMbCSSyMiIXoN7VDhhv0EselLMvdQrvySG12o1MRd0mat-Ysnl3kE=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Some one looks very happy!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":99,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Mendoza","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":101,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Santiago","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>101, \"previous\"=>100, \"next\"=>102}":{"data":{"day":{"number":101,"date":"2018-04-14","post":{"content":"<p>Today started with a <strong>huge</strong> breakfast.

In fact, a whole caravan of 10-15 minivans and 4x4s came\npast us on their way back as we made our way there.</p>\n\n<p>The geysers were small, but continuously boiling patches of water with plumes\nof steam reaching metres above them. There were quite a few dotted around the\nplace and a hot spring fed pool which we took advantage of after lunch. In the\npool, we met three Chilean ladies (who live in Argentina, meaning their\nSpanish was very hard to understand). They had big balls of mud and encouraged\nus to rub it on our faces and shoulders. Afterwards, they broke into a couple\nof Beatles&#39; songs.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> They were great, not sure about the mud though.</span></p>\n\n<p>On the way back, we stopped at the Valley of the Dead, also known as Mars\nValley, just beside the Valley of the Moon. It got one of its names from the\nfact that a Mars rover had been tested in it as it has a comparable landscape.\nWe drove into the valley, parking on the sand and walking up onto a plateau\nwith a view down onto spiky volcanic hills and the massive sand dune we\neventually ran down to get back to the car.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;d booked an AirBnB for our last day in San Pedro after Rosie&#39;s parents had\nleft, but for some reason the guy renting it out refused to tell us the\naddress. We needed to know it so we could arrange our onward transport, so\ntried to get him to tell us it until he cancelled. Very strange. We found a\ncheap hostel anyway.</p>\n\n<p>We also moved into a different hotel, more of a resort than the previous one\nwith separate buildings for each room, slightly out of town. We bought a\ncouple of bags to make it easier to give some of our stuff to Rosie&#39;s parents\nto take back. We had another good dinner, finishing with a chanar cake, made\nfrom a local plant which can be used to produce a sweet flavour.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Chile","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Chile","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OrSG1FnpSlV1C-hfnsW__5DZk2TJy8SBt_hqLIxDyHpv8rQbpw6Ibt33AE025KbOv9OiQbfC71m9stfy4e8xvkanGZwv2MrbmQiF6oL9FN-XgmHEiJzXMJoRBhUkc1bIVgA8bslyi3M=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"The road signs for condors - loveing the little hat","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/63R7mpMH0pIRANzO36yrw4LhDcR1fZp7axP0n_WWK7arfEo5YJVrxU2tGcvHdTOEtnDCJiNb6dCzR6QVNsp1JCCZijutBfy8M7c6-dRyI7kdm22iWspN8adytFi1s_JGzIebYCs8TwY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1798,"aspectRatio":1.3348164627363737,"caption":"The geysers","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nh15Z7gPYmqZbNHEMDN2hvAXbGl_V_IDs3RJzQZVkEY5EicKSsKU5G7_sKhLEVzG1DFJvNuv-CVZ3LUtauzBlMllpxcjTEtLXalTpju4dIOqqkmWNkmooQAFJsKfxiYpZ2blIicdVgk=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"Muddy","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sCdriCb65Ack8NIDhHho7Y-DBXQ7WKOBB0lhq_5a5PqpA5wgKzaeL7LsFYR1TQePBlHyRazB_PxpGnrhkCdwSgY5ycyeEe0kI9sZTmbiLpLNJ4bd1yp5YHuLF84Tvc8ktymu0ahZ2A0=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Vicuña!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oh6JsoIXfmGnX-C2QgcfA27w0vlDOOGbD_uvDuyf9cKSwYHcoBCOAyan_l0qwtyJGqdRtTGKISRAalmrqPqM4SLdiiE_84Mou-GXsxkJ8nzcAxcS692SqWD3TSsZfqjDsUmNyif2fAY=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"The beautiful altiplano","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3zDHllYGao9mXw7O-kBj9B9npww7LL2jAGckeZV12plJgRgMCOFa2OgZktLyO01ckm0gEzD3lViJPKqMOV_jVIu5m0gYtIeTZOhxserk-pfy7njdAq1k92AsUbs_BOYMROOJSwLmgZ0=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"A hop a skip and a jump","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4wWTOYbOki9bfwKgow8TxcBIOmo2pJatfesnHmDkxosQc5tfJqbNP2W7k_wPozJLSakUkDV7xtt-VvvXb-UbzI5CelHajk5xAaCyGOUpt058nki8QukblGvq0YhoKvGuhcEqc6npKSk=w2400","width":2400,"height":1600,"aspectRatio":1.5,"caption":"Llama!","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":106,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Atacama desert","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":108,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Atacama desert","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>108, \"previous\"=>107, \"next\"=>109}":{"data":{"day":{"number":108,"date":"2018-04-21","post":{"content":"<p><div class=\"Rosie\">\nToday&#39;s post is written by a ghost who I&#39;m 90% sure does not read the blog\nbut is none the less an active supporter of RnD travels. It covers our entire\ntime in Chile but focuses on today.\n</div></p>\n\n<p>For the Chilean section of our travels, we signed up with McJack’s Pretty Good\nAdventures Tour group. They are a pretty small operation specializing in bespoke\nitineraries. I feel we have to rate them pretty highly, importantly their rates are very\ncompetitive, and secondly they are Rosie’s parents, and even though I am fairly sure they\ndon’t read this blog, they just might.</p>\n\n<p>Within 24 hours in Santiago we had enjoyed a good meal and more than 12 varietals of wine,\ndon’t worry they were all locally sourced. Some were good, some were excellent,\nwhile they all tasted like wine other flavors that were mentioned, (raspberries, peaches,\nvanilla, tobacco and others) however none of us were able to catch the hints of dusty roads\nand sweaty horses so often found in wines from the neighboring Argentinean region of Malbec. The\nfavoured wine of the week, we checked for consistency by testing several bottles\nover the course of several days, was a Sauvignon Blanc from Matetic Viña, not only\ndoes it have a pale bright color with green hues, an intense mineral and herbal nose,\nit is full of citrus aromas. The plate is fresh and juicy with good acidity, volume and a\nlong elegant finish; it also has a really cool label.</p>\n\n<p>Santiago is a very large sprawling city with many hills, having visited the museum of\nMemory and Human Rights (a sad but compelling catalogue of events from the time\nof the Pinocet dictatorship) and a few of the sites around Bellavista and Cerro San\nCristobel our phone had clocked 9.1 miles an 69 flights of stairs.</p>\n\n<p>The coastal town of Valparaiso, about 2 hour drive from Santiago is a curious town\nconsisting of 45 cerros (hills) that surround a shipping port, each hill forms a\ndistinct community, many in the old town are tiny, very steep the easiest way to get\nfrom one to another is by using the 100 year old funicular system. Street\nartists brightly and intensely decorate the ramshackle and slightly run down streets.\nWhile many are political, there is in general a light air to most of the murals think\nBanks without the attitude.</p>\n\n<p>We greatly enjoyed a visit to the restored museum and former home of Chili’s most\nfamous poet Pablo Neruda in Valparaiso, judging by the eclectic style in which it is\ndecorated I can’t help feeling he would have greatly enjoyed the street art that can\nnow be seen from his quirky home.</p>\n\n<p>All McJack’s nearly good adventures involve a walk, it is usually the signature event\nof their trips and this one was only different in the sense that it seemed it was going\nto be rather modest: A 3-4 kilometer walk with a 1000m gain. What could possibly\ngo wrong? The only anticipated problem was the altitude, but what’s 5,550 meters\n(18,000 feet) when you are with friends.</p>\n\n<p>All started off well, and just so you are not worried, ended well. Some of the bits\nin the middle, however, were a little suspect. The day started with a sound breakfast at which\nDan and Michael slipped a small supply of cakes and biscuits into their pockets.\n2 Litres of water per person - check. Factor 55, 75, 100 suncreen - check.\nEmpanadas - check. Down loaded maps - check. There are 2 routes to Lascar Volcano,\nlet’s just say for reasons that were never clear we took the route less travelled.\nWe turned off the main road and were bumping along a bumpy but passable track,\nwe had a 4 wheel drive and were happy to make us of it.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after leaving the main road we needed to do a little bit road building, we\nthrew a few rocks into a small gulley and we were quickly back on the bumpy but\npassable track. Then we turned a corner to find that the track had deteriorated into\na very narrow steep ledge, rocks on one side, rocks the ground, no rocks on the\nother side just rather a lot of air and a rather steep drop. Rosie got out to clear a few\nrocks from the road. Michael, the driver, got out and said “well what do you think\nguys, can we make it down there?” Clare and Dan got out, we don’t know whether\nthey were thinking they could help guide the car down the very narrow and steep\nledge, whether it would be better if someone was available to go for help if the car\nslid and rolled over and landed upside in the valley below. Or maybe they just didn’t\nwant to be in the car if it slid and rolled over and landed upside in the valley below.\nNo one said it out loud but more than one of us calculated that from the top portion\nthe car could perhaps flip fully over and roll back upside right, from lower down the\nslope it would probably only have enough height to roll over onto the roof. One\nthing that was said, once Michael had skillfully and gingerly negotiated the car down\nthe slope, there was no way, as in no way, to get back up. On this we were all\nagreed.</p>\n\n<p>For the next few kilometers, they felt like miles, we bumped along without a\nproblem, we passed an abandoned car, and as we crossed onto the shoulder of\nLascar Volcano, we could see car tracks heading towards the place we planned to\nstart hiking. Even better than car tracks, we saw a moving car heading in the same\ndirection as us. As we drove higher up the volcano side it got steeper and Michael\nswapped back down to 4 wheel drive, gradually the car got slower, and slower and\nthen it had no power, we could hear the engine, we could see the see the lights but\nthe car had no power. &quot;Oh well&quot; said Clare &quot;we can walk from here&quot;. When we got out, the\naltimeter read above 16,000 feet. At this altitude the effective oxygen concentration\nis ~10% this may explain both Clare’s devil may care attitude and the fact that the\ndiesel powered car we were driving had given up the ghost.</p>\n\n<p>Having driven to 16,300 feet it was mere 2,000 feet gain to get to the crater. That’s\nthe equivalent of parking on the glaciar at Kilimanjaro and then wandering a couple of km\nto the summit. Not so fast my friend, and that’s exactly how we hiked to the caldera,\nnot so fast my friend. Slowly, slowly, we reached the edge of the enormous\nsulphurous carter I will let the pictures speak for the view. As we\nsurveyed the scene, took photos and savoured the moment we each noticed that the\nothers were a behaving a bit odd, nothing dramatic just a bit dopey or clumsey and\ndefinitely getting a bit to close to the edge, the funny thing is I felt fine and didn’t\nunderstand why the others thought I was a getting too close the edge. I think\nperhaps the combination of low oxygen and high sulphur gases was messing with\ntheir minds.</p>\n\n<p>The descent was surprising difficult but we were soon back at the car which started\nno problems, gaining power as we descended, and we speed along the path more\ntraveled back to the main road. As we headed back to San Pedro to Atacama we\nstopped to pick up a hitch-hicker, an articulate young woman who had been out\nrock climbing for the day. She is a local adventure tour guide and provided us with\nlots of information about interesting places we could go and things we could see. We\ntold her that we had been to Lascar for day, she smiled knowingly and we thought it\nwas a smile of approval signifying that she was impressed that we had navigated\nthe route and successfully slogged our way to the top without a local guide. We\nchatted along, we discussed the crowds of tourists that collect at certain times of day\nat certain sites. We remarked on how isolated and alone we were at Lascar, just\nbefore we dropped her off, our friendly local guide casually told us that there were\nno tourists at Lascar at the moment because it had experienced an increase in\nsignature warning events and that the government had closed access and that a 5km\nring around the carter was restricted. I can’t imagine how we missed volcano alert\nsystem from our check list. Nor what those other fools where doing on ths side of an\nactive volacano.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"Rosie\">\nFor those that are unaware, while this may sound like a particuarly bizzare\nadventure, it is fairly normal occurance when travling with McJacks pretty good\nadventures.

The Bolivian side was noticeably run\ndown compared to the Chilean side, but it was all pretty efficient. We had a\nsurprisingly good breakfast of bread, cheese, ham and avocado with biscuits\nand hot drinks. There were several minibuses of us and we were separated into\ngroups of six, one group per 4x4. We clambered into the back of one with a\ncouple from London called Wilson and Sita, an Australian called Caitlin and\nan American called Didi who&#39;d been studying in Sydney with Caitlin, and our\ndriver, Leo.

It was a large formation of volcanic rock,\nprobably formed from lava flows. They were fun and easy to climb, so we spent\na good half an hour there. The other car from the day before had broken down\nagain, so we ended up spending a bit more time there, sitting in the shade of\nthe rocks.</p>\n\n<p>Our car took a couple of tries before it started, but it did work eventually.\nWe didn&#39;t have far to go before stopping to get photos of a camel-shaped rock.\nI don&#39;t think the plan had been to be there for long, but unfortunately our\ncar wouldn&#39;t start again. Luckily, the tour company we went with had three\nother cars which traveled with us. All the drivers crowded around the car&#39;s\nhood, then took out the seats in the middle of the car to get at some of the\nelectrics. Leo suggested that we walk to another set of rocks nearby, so we\ndid. We spent about an hour walking over, climbing up the rocks and listening\nto a bit of the Wheel of Time in the shade. When the six of us decided to\nreturn to the car it was still a hive of activity. A couple of the drivers\nset up lunch for us while the others worked. Leo returned to last night&#39;s\nvillage to get a part, then came back. He also phoned for a replacement car,\nbut finally, thankfully, the car started.</p>\n\n<p>Back in a working car, we set off in convoy. We probably skipped one or two\nstops originally scheduled for today, but we did still visit a few more\nsights. One was a small marsh within another rocky landscape, grazed by llamas\nand leading to an almost black lagoon. Another was a deep canyon with a\ncurving river running through it and precipices out into it that gave a good\nview. There was still a good deal of driving, so we finished the prequel to\nthe Wheel of Time part way through the day. The last stop was at a shop that\nsold quinoa beer and cactus beer - according to the people around who actually\nlike beer, eg Rosie, the quinoa beer was surprisingly good.</p>\n\n<p>For the night, we stayed in a salt hotel - a building partly made from salt\nand with salt sculptures on the wall. We had hot showers, a simple but tasty\nthree course meal accompanied by wine (and coke).

The\ncolours of the sunrise were incredible, especially reflected in the ground\nbelow us - probably the most spectacular sunrise I have ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&#39;t spend too long in the cold, but drove on to an island pushed up out\nof the salt. It was covered in giant cacti and had a great view over the\nflats, so we spent around an hour there. After walking around it and taking\nphotos, we had a breakfast of yoghurt, roast quinoa and cake. We took\nadvantage of the pure white ground to take perspective-trick photos. Soon, Leo\ngot us back in the car, driving us further into the centre of the flats to\ntake even better photos. We spent a good while taking a variety of photos and\nended up with some pretty convincing ones.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I have to say that while the photos\nwere fun to take it was the sheer size of the salt flats that was the most\nimpressive for me.

Once we rejoined\nthem we looked up the recommended restaurants in our guide book and found\nsomewhere with board games. We were the only people in it when we found it,\nbut we had a relaxed three and a half hours with a couple of pizzas, a bad\npisco sour and some pretty decent mulled wine (&quot;vino caliente&quot; is pretty\ncommon in Bolivia). We had a long game of Ludo (which I probably haven&#39;t\nplayed in 15 years)- Rosie won and came third by the skin of my teeth.</p>\n\n<p>This was the third night bus of our trip and was definitely the middle in\nquality.

The centre of\ngovernment moved to La Paz after a civil war, but Sucre has quite a lot of\nhistorical significance. It&#39;s a white city with orange tiled rooves, a grid\nof streets and tiny pavements (clearly not designed for cars).

We had a tour of the building,\noriginally built by the Jesuits (who were very important in early Bolivian\ncolonial history). We learnt that Bolivia was originally much larger, with\nland lost in repeated wars with its neighbours.

These are a\npretty cheap form of public transport ($0.40/£0.30) built in 2014 and being\nextended that give great views over the city. They also really made us\nquestion why anyone would build a city here (answer: originally, gold was\nfound in the river in the valley).

First\nthere was the prison where inmates run the prison and have to pay for\neverything, so have jobs inside and even their families live inside. Some\nprisoners used to charge people to give them tours (possibly with cocaine),\nbut these are now illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Another odd part was the witches&#39; market - a mixture of tourist tat and things\nused for rituals by indigenous people. For example, for small constructions\nlike shops it is customary to get an offering of sugar, alcohol and a llama\nfoetus and bury it all in the foundations to prevent bad things happening\nduring the construction. Apparently larger constructions may require human\nsacrifice and while this is obviously illegal it isn&#39;t really known whether\nit still happens, but we were warned against getting blind drunk or accepting\nfood or drink from strangers in case we end up being buried alive as a\nsacrifice ...<span  class=\"Rosie\"> Apparently pacha mama prefers blondes and apparently even\nDaniel is considered blonde in Bolivia.</span></p>\n\n<p>After the tour we had a bit of a wander (Rosie bought an alpaca sweater), then\nhad a beer and a cocktail from the national spirit, singani. It was good we\nwere inside - it began to bucket with hail and snow mixed in. We watched the\ntraffic and noticed that the majority of vehicles are taxis or minibuses,\nwhich is fair enough, driving up these hills doesn&#39;t look like fun.</p>\n\n<p>We then joined a food tour by the same company as our earlier tour with one\nof the same guides. Because it is May Day, lots of places are closed, so a\ncouple of courses weren&#39;t included in the tour, but we still finished stuffed.\nWe had a lot of food, all pretty good:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pastel</strong> - a  deep fried cheese pastry typically covered in icing sugar (better than it sounds)</li>\n<li><strong>Api</strong> - a warm, sweet white or purple corn drink, spiced with clove and maybe cinnamon</li>\n<li><strong>Llajwa</strong> - a spicy tomato sauce or dip served with most restaurant meals</li>\n<li><strong>Singani sour</strong> - like a Pisco sour, but with Singani (we got to mix one ourselves)</li>\n<li><strong>Pique macho</strong> - A massive pile of chips, beef, sausage, bolied egg, cheese and spicy sauce</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We also had some Bolivian versions of popular food and drink - Bolivian beer,\nwine, brownies (ie, with quinoa) and apple crumble (also with quinoa). Since\nthe growth in popularity of quinoa in the UK and US, it&#39;s more expensive here\nand harder to get - our guide said he used to have it four times a week in his\nchildhood but now only once a month.</p>\n\n<p>We got a taxi back to the hotel because most people don&#39;t recommend walking\nafter dark. We&#39;re only supposed to get taxis with phone numbers on the side\nand signs on top - the others are apparently not trustworthy.

The church also incorporates\nindigenous art including depictions of their deities. The view from the roof\nwasn&#39;t as spectacular as you&#39;d expect for a large church because it&#39;s located\nalmost at the bottom of the bowl of the city.</p>\n\n<p>We spent the afternoon shopping somewhat successfully for souvenirs, then\nless successfully going to a museum. It was shut, and not just for the two and\na half hour lunch break everyone has here.

It was a vegan restaurant that only\noffered tasting menus - we opted for the seven course version and shared the\npaired drinks (some wine, a couple of cocktails and a beer). The food was\nprimarily made from Bolivian ingredients - lots of corn, potatoes and quinoa.\nIt was interesting, but definitely not replicable, and I wasn&#39;t overly full\nat the end. Unfortunately for Rosie, both deserts involved bananas (the\nstrawberry and banana sorbet was fantastic).

The journey took about an hour and a half on a reasonable\nspeed boat packed full of people (we passed the time with a wee bit more\nPokemon, beating the elite four).</p>\n\n<p>Despite being called the island of the sun, when we arrived it was hailing.\nHail turned to rain, which in turn fizzled out in about fifteen minutes. We\nwaited it out, then headed up onto the island proper.</p>\n\n<p>Rosie felt she recognised the island from her previous trip to the area, but\nwe&#39;ve since realised that it&#39;s just because it&#39;s similar. The islands are\nsteep and we spent quite a while climbing up the steps to the ridge. We took\nour time - the lake is at 3,810m and the ridge is at about 4,000m. We saw a\nfew llamas and some local people setting out their wares after the showers. We\nwalked to the top of a couple of hills around the town in the south of the\nisland, getting some great views. The rest of the island is out of bounds to\ntourists at the moment due to a local dispute - something about one group\nbuilding on top of another group&#39;s sacred site, then the wronged party\nresponding by blowing up the offending building with dynamite.</p>\n\n<p>We had lunch with a great view over lake Titicaca. A lot of places here offer\na set menu, so we had soup, trout and dessert (drowned in Hersheys&#39; chocolate\nsauce, unfortunately). Everywhere has trout and we found out that it&#39;s\noriginally Canadian and was introduced.</p>\n\n<p>We got the bus back with enough time to pick up our luggage and return to the\ndock to catch our bus (and also to squeeze in a strawberry and banana shake).\nWe met Wilson and Sita who were also getting the same bus as us, but not\nstaying in Puno. We all got on the bus once it arrived and headed for the\nborder.</p>\n\n<p>This was one of the last borders of our trip, but not the easiest. We arrived\nat the Bolivian side and had to leave the bus with all of our luggage as we\nwere to get on another bus, owned by the same company, on the other side. We\nlined up to go through customs and changed our remaining Bolivianos into\nPeruvian Soles. Some confusion arose when we were told to have our entry slips\nready along with our passports. We hadn&#39;t been given an entry slip and neither\nhad quite a few others. One of the officials (<div class=\"Rosie\"> we think</span>) took Sita&#39;s passport and told her\nthat she would have to pay 50 Bolivianos, but no one else in the same\nsituation had to pay. Wilson took back the passport and our guide from the bus\ncompany talked to the official, but didn&#39;t get much information. We ended up\ngetting through without anyone paying, so we&#39;re pretty sure the official was\njust hoping that Sita didn&#39;t speak enough Spanish to understand and would\nhave just handed over the money. The guide said she&#39;d never seen this in her\ntwo years there.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> I also overheard the guide ringing the main company to\ntell them about the incident so hopefully someone officially complains about\nthis as its very unkind and particularly panic inducing to have someone take\nyour passport away in a forgein country.</span></p>\n\n<p>The Peruvian side was a bit more official, but equally frustrating. I got\nthrough fine, but Rosie had trouble switching passports. As she&#39;s a US\ncitizen, she should enter the US on her US passport, but until now we&#39;ve both\nbeen using UK passports to make things simpler (and cheaper in Bolivia).\nWe&#39;re flying into Ecuador and from Ecuador to the US, so needed to register\npassports, so it makes sense for that one to be Rosie&#39;s US one. Having left\nBolivia, it should be possible to switch passport and enter Peru on the US\none, but the customs official insisted on only accepting the passport with the\nBolivian exit stamp, which should not be necessary as far as we can tell.\nWe&#39;ll sort it out at the next border.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> It was fine, just annoying.</span></p>\n\n<p>Once through the border and onto our fancier, double decker Peruvian bus, we\nsaw a fantastic sunset and listened to our audiobook for the couple of hours\nto Puno. When we arrived, we were bundled onto a shuttle bus, which squeezed\nits way through the tiny streets, stopping a couple of blocks from our hotel\non the main pedestrianised street. The hotel was pretty nice and the prices\non the wall were more than twice than what we&#39;d reserved online.</p>\n\n<p>We got some cash out of an ATM (sadly one with foreign transaction charges),\nthen scouted out dinner. We ended up at another place with a set menu, the\nbest pisco sour Rosie&#39;s had in a while and a great mulled wine and pisco\ndrink with some kind of fruit juice to sweeten it slightly, served in a hot\nceramic mug.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> The last four or five days are missing photos - Rosie is on it, but\nwe haven&#39;t had good enough internet for the last few days to upload &amp; link\nthem.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Bolivia","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Peru","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F2LSVRvayu4Pe8gZS70BIW0_BamMPkQqqu4_rOdpkCwH4OLR4SLc5APQu9udaqXXjR4QDaPAtHVBKOIoeVqLawgRwR9xOh7XJjI5gGe5BPb2PvGkO-R5T3vDwpjsYVgCplgq60u8w0M=w2400","width":2400,"height":1051,"aspectRatio":2.283539486203616,"caption":"Isla del sol","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4DB5Cyh-GiV-DR_wjn9D6ceJAQfTp0hqSeZs2lytE6d2kIPMxtlecEXg6XQpwDiS6N3rH6FVlhdJZy49kXwLQJqJv7qCOREvzuIThv3Agrw2toXG1ZjfSQqRm4OxDvXd-GiqpN1NzLw=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"South americans love their terraces","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FdPru0OtGFNSnE3nEtIg3QIMQTk0pXP4izmfVmy6NpUHqLyBj1WWolcuMbziapOQtRQEB-Qfs5aOsGkp5m6PZG2l2cii6km69XhZ2W-23hPwF1VR5aaUaxa6_hGJYl-Qmwve5NfWVgY=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"Delicious drinks","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g7JgNlELEP7VUYWbJRUGoT-QKAx5o1cv4e56suhOO7Hb2JaiErDFz4pIhhb_P94xs814-Sy1I1vWnmm5uBtB7EfRTc0lvqgY_vzoWk19WGzd7F28gR48ohJK3iO4dKBpIbvnvS_7_Rw=w2400","width":2400,"height":1350,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"caption":"Oh hey peru","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":120,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"La Paz","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":122,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Puno","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>122, \"previous\"=>121, \"next\"=>123}":{"data":{"day":{"number":122,"date":"2018-05-05","post":{"content":"<p>For the first time in what feels like ages we had a decent shower available\nthis morning.

Once we reached the front, the woman serving us\nseemed not to have sold a SIM to a non-Peruvian before, so it took a while.\nTime was getting short as we had a tour booked, so I left to go and buy lunch\n(at a delicious bakery near our hotel).</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"Rosie\"> After finding someone who did know\nhow to sell a sim to a non-Peruvian she slowly managed to fill out the form\nwhile I sat there silently (and then probably not so silently) panicking that\nI was not going to make it back in time.

The main thing to do from Puno is to\nsee the floating islands on lake Titicaca (or &quot;Titihaha in the local language)\nmade out of reeds, so we got on a bout full of other tourists for a half hour\ntrip to the Uros floating islands.</p>\n\n<p>We disembarked onto a reed island with a slightly weird texture under foot. We\ngathered together on a reed bench while our guide and the island&#39;s president\ntold us about the island. There were 21 people living on it and there are\naround 90 islands, each with their own president. The island is built from\n1.5m deep blocks of reed roots in earth, held together with stakes and rope\nfor a few months until the roots join the blocks together. Then a further 1.5m\nmetres of reeds are piled on top to make a platform, then reed huts built on\ntop of even higher reed piles. The floor of the island is replenished with\nreeds every fifteen days.</p>\n\n<p>The people of the islands survive on tourism, so we had a look at their\nvarious handicrafts and paid for a trip in the large catamaran reed boat (kept\nafloat by several thousand empty plastic bottles in the hulls, then wrapped\nwith reeds and decorated with slightly demonic reed cats&#39; heads at the front).\nSeveral of the larger buildings, probably not made from reeds, were the three\nprimary schools. For further education, all the kids need to go to Puno.</p>\n\n<p>Our last stop was a larger island with some small shops and restaurants. We\ngot a passport stamp (by the sounds of it an idea copied from Cusco, but a\ndecent stamp none the less) and plenty of photos. Rosie found that she could\nbuy Cheetos, a US brand not easily found in the UK, so we enjoyed a packet\nof them before getting back on the boat.</p>\n\n<p>Back in Puno, we spent a long time in the cafe part of the bakery I&#39;d bought\nlunch at. They had wifi and a plug, so I passed the time getting the diary up\nto date and programming.</p>\n\n<p>It was raining when we left, but our chosen restaurant was very close by. We\nhad a really good meal, especially my alpaca steak in a sweetish red wine\nsauce with raisins and excelllent mashed potatoes. It was pretty cold, so the\nglass tankards of mulled wine also helped.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> A tankard of mulled wine is quite\nalot of mulled wine though.</span></p>\n\n<p>We returned to our hotel to get picked up for our evening bus. We waited in\nthe small lobby while a Spanish-dubbed CGI film played. It was a ridiculous\nfilm about, as far as we could tell, a bullfighter who didn&#39;t want to kill the\nbull, but it was hilarious in how over the top parts of it were.</p>\n\n<p>We were picked up in a minibus around 9pm. The minibus quickly filled up,\nincluding one girl who seemed really pretty sick and her friend who wasn&#39;t\nquite sure what to do. Rosie gave her some antacids and some advice, but there\nwasn&#39;t much else we could do.</p>\n\n<p>The bus was a bit of a disappointment. The company we&#39;ve booked half of our\nbuses here with claims to be the best, but doesn&#39;t quite live up to that\nclaim. Rosie&#39;s seatbelt didn&#39;t work on one and my footrest didn&#39;t extend\ntoday, but worst so far was that our overnight bus, from 9.30pm to 5am,\nstopped at midnight and we had to change buses.

We were surrounded by imposing\nmountains with the occassional snow cap in the distance.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually we reached the start and piled out of the bus, which promptly\nperformed an impressive 3-point turn in very little space. We had a fairly\nsteep climb to start us off, but quickly reached a tiny channel of water about\na handspan in width which was apparently an Incan canal. We followed this for\nthe next hour and a half, meaning the path was pretty flat.<span  class=\"Rosie\"> At this point\nJose started to tell us about the flora, fauna and history of the area. I was\npretty impressed with his knowledge, right up until he told me that peru had\ngiven potatoes to the Irish just after WWII because they were hungry. After that\npoint I viewed everything he told me with a healthy amount of suspicion. Which\nturned out to be a good view because there were many other interesting\n(read: wrong) facts through out the trip.</div></p>\n\n<p>We stopped further up the valley where our tents had already been set up\nbeside some small buildings. Someone had a deck of cards and a group of us\nplayed a couple of hands of President with quite different rules:\n* twos are the highest card\n* you <strong>have</strong> to play higher than the previous card played\n* if you pass once, you can&#39;t play until the next round\n* the three of clubs starts\n* if three consecutive cards are played, the last person can say &quot;run&quot; to\n  force all following cards to also be consecutive\n* jokers can be played to beat anything (one joker beats a pair or triple)</p>\n\n<p>We then had lunch, which was fantastic. The food would have been great even if\nI hadn&#39;t known it had been prepared in a hut in the middle of nowhere. We had\nthree courses: starter, soup and main course, which itself was four separate\nplatters. For me the highlight was the starter - a chicken and mango ceviche\n(yes, you read that right, no, the chicken wasn&#39;t raw).</p>\n\n<p>After lunch we (slowly) walked up to a glacial lake at about 4,100m. It was\njust below a glacier topping the nearest mountain and was a deep blue. The\nsteep incline gave a lot of us a taste of the altitude and it was a bit of a\nslog. The way down was a lot of quicker, but that may have had something to do\nwith the imposing dark clouds making their way up the valley towards us.</p>\n\n<p>We made it to the huts just before the heavens opened. We were provided with\nhot tea, milo (malted chocolate drink), and salted popcorn. I&#39;d heavily\nrecommend salted popcorn covered in milo powder - it&#39;s great after a day of\nwalking. This was followed by another great meal: soup, four platters and a\ndessert - banana flambe, served <strong>on fire</strong>.

It\nhelped a bit, I think.</p>\n\n<p>We got a collectivo (minibus) out of Cusco to Urubamba to see a few of the\nsights outside the city. Our plan had been to get off at a turnoff to the\nplaces we actually wanted to go, but the driver didn&#39;t stop. Instead, we drove\nsteeply down into a deep valley surrounded by snow-capped mountains. The\nvalley bottom was flat and completely covered by Urubamba, apart from a small\nriver.</p>\n\n<p>We got out at the bus station and pretty much immediately found a taxi driver\nwilling drive us to Moray and Maras and wait for us to see each place. Half\nan hour and a lot of sharp corners later, we arrived at the salineras (salt\npits) of Maras. The salt pits are hundreds of large, shallow basins located\non terraces in a thin valley above Urubamba. There is a natural salty spring\nthere (I can confirm after tasting - the water is very salty) which can be\nchannelled into each of the pits. The water then evaporates over the next few\nweeks until just the salt remains. The top few layers can be used in cooking,\nwhile the lower layers are sold as bath salts.

We had a tapas dinner at the Museo de\nPisco (a restaurant, not a museum) and a few drinks.

The shot of hot chocolate was worth\nit.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;d booked another cooking class for today, which turned out to be by a chef\nwho used to work at the previous class we&#39;d gone to. We&#39;d specifically asked\nfor a different menu so we didn&#39;t just make the same thing, so had a private\nclass. That was great - we skipped the normally standard market visit and had\nplenty of space in the kitchen (it would have been cramped with a group of\nmore than four).</p>\n\n<p>We made another passionfruit pisco sours (that&#39;s ok, they&#39;re prety tasty) and\nlearnt that not only is Pisco named after a town in Peru, it&#39;s named after the\nceramic jars from Pisco that it is aged in, also called piscos.</p>\n\n<p>Our starter was another Japanese/Peruvian fusion called tiraditos. It&#39;s\nsimilar to ceviche in that it&#39;s white fish cooked in acid, but everything\nisn&#39;t mixed together. Instead, we laid thin slices of fish on a plate, then\ncovered it with a lime and coriander sauce, then added chunks of avocado,\nsweet potato puree and Andean algae. Rosie spent a long time ensuring all her\navocado chunks stood up in the same way - I suppose the photos will show if it\nwas worth the effort.</p>\n\n<p>Our main course was quinoa-crusted alpaca steaks on a bed of roasted potatoes\ncovered in a chimmichurri sauce. Similar to British and Irish cooking, but\nhard to replicate as alpaca isn&#39;t the easiest to get hold of. The potatoes\nwere also pretty different - one tasting similar to what I would call a\npotato, but with purple lines through it and another a vibrant yellow and much\ncloser in taste and texture to beetroot than potatoes.</p>\n\n<p>Our dessert was a (massive) quinoa creme brulee. The quinoa was mixed in and\nsank to the bottom, giving a range of textures, but I&#39;m not sure if it really\nimproved the dish. We kind of cheated, too - the brulee wasn&#39;t blow-torched\nsugar, but instead a sheet of praline that had been crushed in a mortar and\npestle then sprinkled on top. The best bit of the dish was the salt in the\ncream - our chef, Chris, put in a surprisingly large pinch, but it really\nadded.</p>\n\n<p>The class finished just after 1pm, earlier than expected and giving us some\nfree time that we didn&#39;t really know what to do with. Rosie got a cup of tea\n(it was still before 2pm, so it&#39;s ok apparently), then we sat in the main\nsquare for a while. From behind us we heard a real racket approaching until\na parade of some sort spilled into the square. It wasn&#39;t that big, maybe one\nhundred people, but it was still mayhem, maybe with a hint of organisation.\nThere were a couple of trumpeters playing some sort of tune, but way more\npeople with assorted instruments just making a din (not least the children\nwith airhorns). There were people dressed as circus performers doing some\nminor acrobatics and juggling and people in all sorts of costumes, including\na guy with an oversized cardboard TV camera pretending to film them all. There\nwasn&#39;t an obvious reason for it all, so it was pretty bizarre.</p>\n\n<p>We watched the chaos for a while, then did a brief bit of souvenir shopping\n(you have to finish a trip like this with at least one ridiculous bit of at\nmost semi-useful tourist tat). We returned to our hotel to pick up our stuff\nand got a taxi to the bus station, only to get caught behind the parade. Our\ndriver said it was a protest about the price of living in Cusco, but if so,\nthat is a strange way of protesting.</p>\n\n<p>We were very early for our bus, but at least there were places for us to\ncharge our devices. The bus itself was pretty comfortable, but was still a\nfourteen hour journey. Just like a long-haul flight, the seats all had little\nscreens in the back of them so we could watch Spanish-dubbed American films\nwith English subtitles. Rosie&#39;s screen stopped working, so we shared (there\nwere two headphone ports for each screen) and found the remake of Jumanji\nsurprisingly ok.</p>\n","__typename":"Post"},"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Peru","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"},{"node":{"area":{"country":{"name":"Peru","__typename":"Country"},"__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"},"photos":{"edges":[{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CPftxoEPUBh3Qtcawz-86U8lKVnk9FqpbMrQ-izyz6xgcdnkmklvEmbPfO368QqeGWMg1zLXwD_9o-mhx1mLMYhkihx0n73lKOPs0BSlL7SJV0JhK9k_R6qlPXfh15Pg_i0LICnfoUs=w2400","width":2400,"height":1800,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"caption":"I think it looked pretty good, tasted better","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/34PGMhHTjw-mnHdIVnO2mS_8t-4vSAXvyFWlHdt8KMm5A-Xlfew266GB3Nwh0d6fs9_MK4iscTLK3jaL8eX5ux6iX2mM-ZCIephHL6nWTiDZRQATKMzWruU9FULnsGtKQKr7Q21rUgc=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"Main course","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"},{"node":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T5rKdFiKNICXVF1XpuDasjN0MkyVDWWm2DAd0n88fPFY7wslJfRo7AABjP5OFY8JyzRriqLytO4xF0hajJFH9eUZw2gBQbRARN2bzpHvT8eHR1teU3QCQRip39PRAS0Y0AP6D-O7mPs=w2400","width":2400,"height":3200,"aspectRatio":0.75,"caption":"Pudding","__typename":"Photo"},"__typename":"PhotoEdge"}],"__typename":"PhotoConnection"},"__typename":"Day"},"previous":{"__typename":"Day","number":139,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Cusco","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}},"next":{"__typename":"Day","number":141,"locations":{"edges":[{"node":{"area":{"name":"Nazca","__typename":"Area"},"__typename":"Location"},"__typename":"LocationEdge"}],"__typename":"LocationConnection"}}}},"{\"dayNumber\"=>141, \"previous\"=>140, \"next\"=>142}":{"data":{"day":{"number":141,"date":"2018-05-24","post":{"content":"<p>The vast majority of today was spent on buses.

  Our last full day in Ho Chi Minh City started reasonably early as we were
  getting picked up at 8am. We learnt that apparently very few of the restaurants
  on the main backpacker streets near where we're staying open before 8am, so
  ended up with a pretty meagre breakfast.

  The day's activity was visiting the Cu Chi tunnels. These are a massive network
  of underground tunnels outside the city, up to 10 metres below the surface and
  apparently there's over 120km of them. The Viet Cong hid in them during
  bombings, lived in parts of them and used them during attacks to surprise their
  enemies.

  The tunnels themselves are pretty claustrophobic - 1 metre high and less than
  that in width, you can either crawl or just about walk stooped over and bending
  your knees. These tunnels had also been increased in size to these dimensions
  for tourists and had some lighting and ventilation added. The originals must
  have been awful. <R> I had a minor panic attack when the guide pretended to trap
  me in one of them and I thought I had gotten stuck, they were very small. </R>

  In addition to the tunnels themselves, we watched a Vietnamese propaganda film
  from the sixties about Cu Chi and saw a wide variety of unpleasant traps used to
  maim and kill unwitting enemies. There were even gunshots to be heard in the
  background as there's a shooting range on site where tourists can fire guns from
  the time of the war. <R> The constant sound of gunfire probably made the place
  feel more realistic but was very loud when you were anywhere near the gun range. </R>

  At the end, we learnt a bit about the food the Viet Cong ate. I'm sure they had
  some rice, but they also apparently had tapioca / cassava, which we were able to
  try. It's pretty tasteless boiled by itself, but we were given sugar and ground
  peanuts to dip it in, which I doubt is authentic. Tasty, though. We were shown
  the chimneys for cookfires, deliberately designed to disperse the smoke to look
  like mist rising from the jungle in the early morning to disguise it.

  We spent the afternoon wandering through the city, seeing the cathedral and
  stumbling upon another Tet celebration - a dragon dance on the street. We had
  a bit more caramelized pork (it's just so good) and had some decent
  Mediterranean food at a busy four-floored restaurant. It was oddly organised,
  with a kitchen on the ground and top floors, bread made downstairs and
  everything else upstairs, forcing the wait staff to spend all their time racing
  up and down the stairs. <R> The poor members of staff must have legs of steel,
  one guy in particular could climb 4 flights of stairs, 2 steps at a time at a
  dead run. It was pretty impressive. </R>

  One of the main things Mendoza is known for is for its vineyards and
  particularly its Malbec. We'd booked a tour of Valle de Uco, one of the more
  famous wine-producing areas. It's about an hour south of Mendoza, so we needed
  some form of transport and renting a car for wine tasting didn't seem like a
  great idea.

  We had a rushed breakfast, then were picked up in a minibus by Ampora tours.
  There was a driver and a young tour guide along with a group of three
  Americans. They turned out to work for Disney as salespeople and event
  managers in Argentina for events to promote the opening of a new part of
  Disneyworld. It turned out there was another guy on our tour, close to passed
  out on the back seat, having been out last night and not having slept.

  Our first bodega (a winery here) was picturesque, surrounded by vines and
  within sight of the snow-capped Andes. It is owned by a French family who had
  made wine in southern France, then sold their vineyards to buy land here. A
  guide from the bodega showed us the resevoir that fed the irrigation for the
  vines, then led us into the winery itself. She showed us the steel tanks,
  concrete tanks and French oak casks used to ferment the wine (cheaper wines in
  steel or concrete, more expensive in oak). She then took us below to the
  basement to see the oak barrels that the wines were aged in (the more
  expensive the wine, the longer the time it spends in barrels and the newer the
  barrels). Finally, she showed us the bottled wine, stored standing up if
  closed with a fake cork or screw cap, stored lying down if corked (so that the
  cork doesn't dry out, shrink and let in some air). <R> My favourite part was
  watching them mix the wine by pumping the liquid from the bottom of the tank
  through a massive sieve in a bathtub and then pumping it up over the top of
  the tank. This causes the grape solids to mix with the liquid as apparently
  they float after a while. </R>

  Our tasting was also in the basement. We had one white and three reds, not too
  much, but I could feel it by the end. We learnt that you should be able to
  tell a Malbec solely by its colour (slightly violet at the edges rather than
  red) and that Chardonnay is often disliked by people who dislike bananas.

  We had about a 30 minute drive to the next winery and learnt that our guide,
  Alecio, had only been at the company for a week and a half. He seems to have
  had loads of other jobs though, despite being 24, and spent a year travelling
  through South America.

  Our second winery was actually the owners' house, with the wine production
  in a huge room off the side of the house and the wine stored in the cellar.
  The building was impressive, open and airy with lots of mirrors and local art
  (including a picture of Mickey Mouse that the Disney guys loved). It was
  closer to the Andes and our tasting was outside with a stunning view.

  Our third winery was even closer to the Andes. Apparently the work of the same
  architect as the previous one, but much larger. This was less of a tour as it
  was primarily a six course lunch with wine pairings. I don't remember as much
  about the wines here as I was more focused on the food and the conversation
  (now significantly loosened by the wine). The food was decent, the steak was
  large but not obscene and the raspberry "foam" (ice cream) was delicious.

  I'll admit I fell asleep for about an hour of the two-hour drive home - I
  think only Rosie, Alecio and the driver remained awake for the whole time. It
  was a fun day with great people, and unsurprisingly we didn't end up getting
  dinner.

  Today was another travel day on a bus, but with spectacular views as we
  crossed the Andes. The bus was at 10.30am, with only a little hassle and an
  enforced tip to the baggage handler, we pretty much left on time.

  We had the front seats on the top deck of the bus. The front window had a kind
  of netting on it to reduce the glare, but slightly spoiling the view,
  especially through a camera. There was also a message board and TV directly
  above us (which played Spanish-dubbed movies throughout our journey). The side
  window, however, was unfettered and had a decent view.

  The scenery was immense. Sharp mountains for hours on end, some snow capped,
  but little vegetation and a crystal-clear sky. The road was decent with
  several long, and occasionaly poorly lit, tunnels.

  We had a border crossing into Chile in the middle of the journey, which I'd
  read could be arduous, take several hours and include strict bag checks. It
  only took about half an hour - everyone piling off the bus to get their
  passports checked, given a piece of paper, then back to the bus to grab
  luggage, hand in a customs form and put the bags through an xray, then back to
  the bus. Easy. <R> The whole thing was so surprisingly efficient that we kept
  asking if we had done it correctly because we couldn't believe it could be that
  easy. </R>

  The time flew by, particularly because we listened to the last few hours of
  A Memory of Light, the last book in The Wheel of Time series. We'd both read
  it, but we started listening to it over two years ago in January 2016.

  We arrived in Chile and had a bit of a saga getting out money. The first ATMs
  we found were inside a building that was having its glass walls cleaned, so
  apparently we couldn't enter. The next one we found was broken and being
  fixed. The third wouldn't accept our cards. The fourth worked, but only after
  we realised that, unlike any other country so far, we had to select an option
  stating that our card was foreign. Of course, after that we saw ATMs
  everywhere.

  We took the subway into the city from the bus station to get to the shared
  apartment in which we have a room for the night. The man at reception wasn't
  able to get a hold of anyone for a while, so we played Heads Up on Rosie's
  phone in the lobby. It was ok with two players, but is better with more.

  Eventually, a guy came down to let us into the flat - he'd been in the pool.
  We quickly got out our laundry and worked out where we could wash it in the
  building, then changed and headed to the pool and jacuzzi as indicated on the
  signs on every floor. They were open air pools on the roof and,
  disappointingly, were cold. It's not that warm here, probably around 20
  degrees Celsius at that point, but the view of Santiago at sunset was great
  even if we didn't go into the pool or non-functional jacuzzi. To add to the
  cool reception, the shower in the flat was at best lukewarm, too ...

  Once our washing was done, we were pretty hungry. It was between 8pm and 9pm,
  so just when people were starting to eat here. We found a decent-looking
  Italianish place, had some pasta and a pizza and Rosie had her first pisco
  sour of South America (at least, on this trip).

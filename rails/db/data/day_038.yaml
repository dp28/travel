  Today was our organised, all-inclusive tour to Mai Chau. <R> These are not words
  I normally like, but having woken up with yet another case of the sniffles I was
  pleased to not really have to worry about where we were doing or how we were
  getting there </R>. Mai Chau is a
  mountainous region west of Hanoi with steep cliffs and flat flood plains covered
  in rice paddies. We were picked up by a large tourist bus in the tiny street in
  front of our hotel in Hanoi, then, after four and a half hours, were dropped
  with the rest of the bus load at a hotel in a town in Mai Chau.

  We had lunch sitting at a table where everyone else spoke Spanish. We could
  follow quite a lot of what was being said, but it was hard to join in. <R> We
  did give it our best shot and they were very kind about helping us. </R> We then
  checked in and went to our room. It seems as if we've been lucky enough to be
  mistakenly upgraded - we've got a huge room, A/C (not that it's needed), hot
  shower and decent bed when we only paid for a private room with a fan. I'm
  certainly not complaining.

  We spent the afternoon on an organised bike tour with the other 21 tourists. It
  was slow going with that many people on mountain bikes that couldn't change gear
  (they had plenty of gears, just no gear shifters, <R> just why... </R>).
  We cycled both on the road
  and on paths between paddies. The frequent pauses to regroup did allow us to
  admire the scenery and for the guide to answer questions. One man was aghast
  that they'd erected electricity pylons in the valley because it spoilt the
  view for tourists. He'd rather they bury the electric cables underneath the
  flooded rice paddies, apparently. <R> He later asked if the small hut that we
  stopped at to buy traditional weavings had a card machine, so I'm not convinced
  he really thought things through before he said them. </R>

  We had a buffet dinner and then watched some local dancing. There were a few
  audience participation dances at the end, one involving drinking rice wine and
  another where several people brought large bamboo poles on the ground together
  and apart while everyone else tried to step through without getting their feet
  caught. <R> Once again I was quite glad to be on an "all-inclusive" thing, there
  is no way I could have got Daniel to go to a local dance without it. Also they
  made me some ginger tea which was just smashed ginger, hot water, and a little
  bit of honey. My sore throat felt so much better, it was amazing.</R>

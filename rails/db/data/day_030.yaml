  Another bus day. We were up early to get our 7.45am bus to Kratie.
  Unfortunately, Rosie wasn't feeling so well, something a bus journey was
  unlikely to help. Luckily, it didn't seem to make things much worse.

  We arrived in Kratie six or seven hours later. It's a relatively small town, so
  we were close to our guest house for the next two nights. We had a cheap lunch
  at the guest house, then booked tomorrow's activity and the bus for the next
  day. Then we planned a little bit of what we'll do in Chile and I caught up with
  work emails again.

  Rosie, despite not having much of an appetite, found an excellent place for
  dinner. I had a surprisingly good main - chicken bolognese crepe. I saw it on
  the menus of at least a couple of the restaurants here and it was intriguing.
  Currently, I'm trying to set things up so that Rosie can add photos to this
  site, which, like most programming tasks, is taking a little longer than
  expected. <R> I finished my book! </R>

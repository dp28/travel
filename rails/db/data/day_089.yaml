  This was a long, **long** day. About 38 hours I think, maybe 28 awake.
  Because we crossed the international date line, the timeline of today was a
  bit odd - our last flight left at 8pm and arrived at 4pm on the same day ...

  We were up just after 7am to get our first flight, and to have our last
  Australian culinary experience - a Timtam slam. We got an Uber to the airport
  and Rosie got a tea with the last of our Australian cash.

  Our first flight was a decent three hours to New Zealand. We were flying with
  Air Newzealand which had a great selection of films (unsurprisingly including
  all of the Lord of the Rings films). Even the meal was pretty good (for a
  flight).

  We had five hours in Auckland - standard airport, so we read a bit, added a
  few days to the diary and did a little programming. Our flight to Buenos Aires
  was a further twelve hours, so a lot more waiting around, but this time with
  films to pass the time. Because we were arriving in the afternoon I thought
  it would be best not to sleep (most of the rest of the people on the plane
  didn't seem to have the same opinion). I ended up watching four or five films,
  by far the best being the Fugitive, and a few episodes of Rick and Morty.

  Pretty groggy, we landed and got an Uber to our hotel. It had one of those
  lifts with wire mesh walls up the inside of the staircase and stopped abruptly
  at the third floor. As far as we could tell, there were no other guests at
  the five-room hotel. Our room was pretty different to other places we've
  stayed - a single bed with a steep ladder/staircase leading to a double bed
  above the door, hanging partially over the edge of the platform that supported
  it.

  Our first priority was to try and get some local currency, which proved
  surprisingly difficult. We tried four ATMs and all of them were out of money.
  It turns out that in addition to last Thursday and Friday being public
  holidays for Easter, today was also a public holiday, meaning no one will have
  refilled the ATMs. <R> That being said everytime we have seen an ATM in
  argentina since there has been a massive queue of people outside it so maybe
  its just really hard to get cash out here. </R>

  After failing to get any money, we just decided to find somewhere to eat that
  accepted card. We found an Italian restaurant that was close to deserted at
  8pm - apparently, people don't eat here until 9 or 10pm. That's a pretty big
  change from South East Asia, and definitely from the Gili islands, where
  places would be packed around sunset. I had a fantastic mozzarella-stuffed
  gnocchi with a creamy tomato sauce that I wish I could replicate.

  We collapsed into bed, exhausted. <R> I mean its not every day you cross the
  international date line... every other day maybe. </R>

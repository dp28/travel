:entry: "\nWe left Koh Mak at 9am from the pier just outside our resort. It was a
  loud, if uneventful \njourney. <R> With a distinct lack of chickens. </R> The speedboats
  they use have three pretty huge outboard\nmotors, so it's not that easy to listen
  to anything else. I got a decent way through my book, though.\n\nOnce we got back
  to the mainland we got a songthaew (with a very low roof - ouch) to the bus station\nand
  caught the 11am bus to Bangkok. Six hours of the Wheel of Time later, we arrived
  at a large bus\nstation, refusing offers of tuk tuk rides because we knew that the
  trains in Bangkok were great.\n\nWe were wrong. <R> So so wrong. </R> Traveling
  on Bangkok's public transport at rush hour is nothing\nlike during the day.We needed
  travel two or three miles as the crow flies, which without rucksacks we would\nhave
  walked.There wasn't a direct link, so we needed to go three sides of a square to
  get there - a skytrain,\na subway and another skytrain, only a stop or two on each.
  Each train and station was increasingly\npacked full of people. In the second train,
  there was no room to move. We had to wait in line for\nabout half an hour before
  enough people got off the skytrain for us to (just) fit on.\n\nAfter close to an
  hour and a half, we got to our hotel, which was surprisingly nice. Unlike our\nprevious
  hotel in Bangkok, the windows actually opened to the _outside_, not just a fake
  hedge. We\nfound an Islamic Thai restaurant & bakery and had some decent food, interesting
  (really sweet) Thai\nsweets and a fantastic strawberry shake - probably just ice
  blended with loads of fresh strawberries\nand a bit of sugar syrup. After the frustrating
  journey through Bangkok, the meal was just what we\nneeded. <R> The strawberry milkshake
  in particular was on point! </R>\n"

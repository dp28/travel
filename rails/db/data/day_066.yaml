  More fantastic, cheap Indian food from the hawker stalls for breakfast. If you
  lived in Singapore it's probably not worth cooking - so much great choice is
  available for so little money relative to how much people make. This morning
  we had a dosa and a biryani (briyani here). So good, but I ended up very full.

  As we were getting food it began to rain, with ominous clouds promising more
  later in the day. Our plan was to go on a walking tour, so we definitely
  needed some cover. Unfortunately, while packing the bag for the day our water
  had leaked, drenching my coat. So, after breakfast, we picked up Rosie's coat
  and bought me a lovely bright blue poncho for $1 so that all of Singapore
  could identify me more easily as a tourist. <R> He only had to wear it for like
  15 minutes... Besides I think the whole world knows that Daniel is a tourist
  even without the poncho. </R>

  We took the subway (MRT here) to the centre of town to join our
  pay-what-you-want walking tour called Sneak Peak Singapore. We joined a group
  of about 20 others with our guide being a young local guy of Chinese descent
  in a pink t-shirt. He'd recently finished his degree in urban planning and now
  worked for the government planning department, which definitely coloured the
  content of the tour. Not that I'm complaining; the planned-out nature of
  Singapore and it's development was fascinating to learn about.

  We started by the river with a brief intro to the early history of Singapore
  700 years ago, then skipped to the start of British influence in the early
  19th century. Darren, our guide, explained the politics of the area at the
  time and how the British asked for a trading port in Singapore after lending
  military aid to an elder brother of the ruling family of the Johore Sultanate
  who's younger brother had taken the throne. They'd then not charged any tax
  at the port, enabling it to outcompete the Dutch ports in the same area (the
  Straits of Melacca). <R> This was all explained with the help of a map and some
  laminated pictures that he pulled from his magical bag. </R>

  We then made our way through Chinatown, learning plenty as we went. It is
  fairly central, so is surrounded by skyscrapers, but four of its districts
  have been preserved with the old two to five storey shophouses. They're
  pretty thin as the colonial government used to tax buildings by the width of
  their shopfront on the main street, not by area, leading to long, thin
  buildings up to five times longer than they were wide. <R> At this point it
  began to rain so we all pulled on coats and ponchos and for those that didn't
  have a poncho with them Darren pulled about a dozen of them from his magical
  bag. It only rained for about 15 minutes though which was nice because when it
  did rain, it rained really heavily. </R>

  Darren also pointed out the original shore line of Singapore, now two
  kilometres from the sea. Huge amounts of Singapore are built on reclaimed land
  - something like 25%. The earth came from hills, many of which used to be in
  Chinatown. These used to give rise to a large number of wells, forming the
  city's primary water source. Water was transported in barrels on oxcarts and
  was so common that it affects the area's name even now. In many other cities,
  the Chinatown is called something like "Chinese street" in Chinese, but here
  it is the three words "ox", "water" and "cart" (I forget the ordering). <R> At
  this point it was getting rather hot so Darren pulled some fans and some frozen
  wet wipes out from his magical bag to pass around so we could cool ourselves
  down... you're starting to see why I think this bag is magic. </R>

  As we walked, Darren also pointed out some other sides of Singapore. We passed
  an electricity substation which had a sign on it warning people not to enter.
  It didn't say it was a substation, it had a picture of a soldier aiming a
  rifle at another man with his hands up. Darren said that this was better than
  it used to be - ten years ago, the signs were all over the place and the
  without the gun had been lying on the ground. Apparently now they ask
  questions before shooting ...

  At several points we tried Singaporean food: at a Chinese bakery, a
  Peranakan (mixed Chinese & Malay going back 700 years) sweet cafe and at
  another hawker court. The Peranakan sweets (kueh) were delicious - mixtures of
  gelatinous rice with various fruit flavours and creams and some pastry. I got
  to taste durian, which was pretty good, but I don't think it was strongly
  flavoured. The hawker food was also good - Hainan chicken rice (what it sounds
  like), popiah (the best spring rolls we've had so far - a variety of veg with
  a slightly sweet sauce and crunchy partly-ground peanuts), and carrot cake.
  Carrot cake is a misnomer - apparently the word for "carrot" and "white
  radish" are very similar in Chinese, but I've no idea why it's called cake.
  It's ground radish and rice, made into balls, then fried. The "black" version,
  which we had, is also cooked in soy sauce. It's a slightly odd, soft texture,
  but good. I probably won't be making it any time soon (unlike the popiahs). <R>
  We also learned that at hawker centers in singapore, if you place a small, cheap
  item on the table, it is considered reserved and no one else will sit there.
  Cue Darren and his magical bag which held several of such items. </R>

  We ended at a government housing block, where we learnt that 81% of people
  here live in government housing. We're not exactly sure what he meant by
  "government housing", but probably government **built** housing, as it can
  be sold after 5 years. The government owns the building after the 99 year
  lease comes to term. The housing seems pretty good - according to Darren, the
  private equivalent is the same standard except with a swimming pool, a balcony
  and a security guard you don't need. The government flats we saw were around
  1 million US dollars while the private ones were another 700,000.

  The government flats also drew our attention to some of the interesting
  approaches of the Singapore government. They use social engineering quite a
  bit (but not in the cyber-security sense). Darren described it as trying to
  create the ideal society, but using pragmatic approaches rather than waiting
  for ideal solutions. For example, some time after the subway was introduced,
  people kept leaving chewing gum on the doors, causing them to jam, preventing
  the train from moving and screwing up the entire system. The government
  reaction was to ban the sale and purchase of chewing gum, which remains to
  this day. Another example is that to prevent hippy culture, in the sixties
  foreign men with long hair had to cut it before entering the country and local
  men with long hair were served last at all government offices. Finally, a more
  serious example is that in order to buy a government flat, you need to be
  married or have proof that you will marry soon. The government believes that
  the nuclear (heterosexual) family is the building block and uses this method
  to encourage that.

  Also interesting was some of the personal financial policy. For an average
  salary (very roughly S$5000/$3750/£2500 per month), the income tax rate is
  only 3.5%. However, 20% is put into a compulsory savings account, with another
  17% added by your employer. This can only be spent on:
    * your own (or immediate family's) healthcare
  * property
  * your children's education
  * your pension

  Healthcare is not free and there is no welfare state, and while there are
  provisions for those with low incomes, it is possible to fall through the
  cracks in the system and be dependent on charity funds.

  Anyway, we went up to the 50th floor of one of seven government housing blocks
  which were linked by a roof terrace at that level. They're also linked by an
  800m running track surrounding them 24 floors below. The view was amazing,
  just on the outskirts of downtown, near many of the skyscrapers. Recent
  planning policy has made it compulsory for all new buildings to have **at
  least 100%** of the area of the footprint of the building as horizontal green
  space within the building. This means many of the buildings are very green,
  with garden levels and rooftop parks - even some with plants growing up the
  height of the building on the outer walls.

  We ended our tour and made our way to two light shows, both of which were
  free. The first was in the Gardens by the Bay, a pretty recently developed
  public garden space built (like everywhere else) on reclaimed land. The light
  show is in the supertree grove (shown on Planet Earth 2). The supertrees are
  massive pink metal structures reminiscent of branching trees with plants
  growing up around the struts. They are impressive and would be imposing if it
  wasn't for the nearby skyscrapers. <R> It is pretty cool but there is a lot of
  concrete around for something that is a garden, it could do with a bit more
  green. </R>

  We lay on the ground with the crowds in the centre of the grove and watched
  the trees light up to a variety of Disney soundtracks culminating with Star
  Wars. It was somewhat bizarre, but so is the rest of the place. We had dinner
  in the gardens' own hawker court, Satay by the Bay. Rosie enjoyed the satay
  while I went for another Indian bread, murtabak - a stuffed pancake, in this
  case with mutton.

  We then left the park, walking alonside the water to the hulking Marina Bay
  Sands hotel - three huge, curved tower blocks supporting a slightly bent
  platform almost like a ship above them. It also has a light show set within
  the bay, this time made primarily from water jets. It also creates moving
  pictures from lights shone through sprayed mist. At points, the jets looked
  like lava and the music was overwhelmingly loud. The hard rock was somewhat
  over the top and didn't quite go with the gentle singing. Pretty odd. <R> It
  was very very intense, espcially after the twinkly lights and disney music of
  the super trees. </R>

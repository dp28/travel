  We had the same breakfast as yesterday - salteñas and cinnamon tea. We checked
  out of our hostel, leaving our luggage there and after a bit of a faff caught
  the bus to the botanical gardens at the edge of the city.

  The gardens are really quite large - mainly forest, but with some organised
  gardens. We saw plenty of animals: massive butterflies, a big red squirrel,
  several large birds of prey, lots of smaller birds, and a sloth. Several
  things we've read call Santa Cruz the "unofficial sloth capital of the world"
  and Rosie was particularly keen to see one. Luckily, she got her wish, even if
  the sloth wasn't posing particularly photogenically. <R> We saw a sloth!! </R>

  We got the bus back into the city to pick up our laundry, but it wasn't yet
  ready despite what they had agreed with Rosie two days ago. Rosie had earlier
  found a well-reviewed cafe a couple of streets away. We had an excellent early
  dinner of crepes and fajitas along with a minty pineapple juice recommended
  by the owner. <R> The owner is my new best friend, she was so lovely. </R>

  We picked up our laundry, then collected our luggage and got a taxi to the
  airport. We quickly got through security and killed a couple of hours with
  the Wheel of Time and Pokemon Emerald, with a little programming thrown in.

  The flight was quick and fine, landing in el Alto area of La Paz at about
  4,000m of elevation. La Paz is situated in a valley and has overflowed its
  boundaries, meaning that some of it is at 3,100m and some is at 4,000m and
  there are some very steep hills. We got our first sight of this as our taxi
  rounded a corner and the bowl of La Paz was spread out glittering below us in
  the night.

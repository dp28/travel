  The culmination of our trek was the trip to Machu Picchu. Unfortunately, this
  involved getting up at 4.10am to queue for a bus, getting one after 5.30am and
  into Machu PicchuÂ sometime after 6am.

  Jose gave us a two-hour tour, showing us the different sections and
  architecture in the city. Apparently it had probably supported around 2,500
  people, which is why only 2,500 people are allowed in at any one time. That,
  and the fact that part of the city is slowly sinking. We saw the terraces of
  the agricultural section and various drainage systems to deal with the large
  amount of rain (more than Glasgow). The walls of the temples of the sun, water
  and earth were particularly impressive, incorporating some of the huge chunks
  of granite along with perfectly carved blocks in walls without mortar. Jose
  brought us to one of the quarries, showing us several methods that were used
  to shape the stone. Most of the stones were brought to the site of a new
  building then shaped using haematite tools brought from far away.

  Our tour finished with twenty minutes to make it to the start of our booked
  walk for the day. At the altitude and with all the one way systems in place,
  we just made it in time for he 10am cutoff. We'd booked to climb Machu Picchu
  mountain (which Machu Picchu is named after - the original name is lost). This
  is the larger of the two mountains you can climb at the site, and less popular
  so still had tickets.

  The walk turned out to be harder and steeper than we expected. It was pretty
  much steps the entire way, 600m with some steep drops without any barriers.
  We made it to the top in an hour and twenty minutes and were rewarded with a
  great view over Machu Picchu nestled in the surrounding mountains.

  It was a steep descent back down the steps, but given the rush we were in to
  start the mountain it's one of the few mountains I've finished less tired than
  when I went up.

  Originally, we'd planned to stay al day in Machu Picche as we'd read that most
  people leave in he early afternoon and there's better light in the evening.
  However, that was out of date information - now people who go up in the
  morning have to leave by 1pm and another cohort of 1,000 people come up in the
  afternoon using a separate ticket. So we got our passports stamped and went
  down along with Tom, Stu and Frank and had a quick lunch at the restaurant
  from the night before.

  We said goodbye to everyone at the train station, then checked into another
  (cheaper) hotel. We were pretty tired and didn't feel like wandering around
  the own, so for once used the TV in our room and indulged in a bad film
  (X-Men: The Last Stand). We met Eric for dinner at a craft beer place and
  had a surprisingly good quinoa creme caramel (much better than it sounds).

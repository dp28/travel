  Our last full day in Cusco, but we were both in a bit of a funk. We had
  breakfast at a different bakery from yesterday, this time with better tea. It
  helped a bit, I think.

  We got a collectivo (minibus) out of Cusco to Urubamba to see a few of the
  sights outside the city. Our plan had been to get off at a turnoff to the
  places we actually wanted to go, but the driver didn't stop. Instead, we drove
  steeply down into a deep valley surrounded by snow-capped mountains. The
  valley bottom was flat and completely covered by Urubamba, apart from a small
  river.

  We got out at the bus station and pretty much immediately found a taxi driver
  willing drive us to Moray and Maras and wait for us to see each place. Half
  an hour and a lot of sharp corners later, we arrived at the salineras (salt
  pits) of Maras. The salt pits are hundreds of large, shallow basins located
  on terraces in a thin valley above Urubamba. There is a natural salty spring
  there (I can confirm after tasting - the water is very salty) which can be
  channelled into each of the pits. The water then evaporates over the next few
  weeks until just the salt remains. The top few layers can be used in cooking,
  while the lower layers are sold as bath salts. Overall, the valley itself is
  a spectacular patchwork of white and brown as some pits are ready for harvest
  while others have just been harvested.

  After the salt pits we went to Moray - a series of terraces in concentric
  circles. The current theory is that the terraces were used by the Incas to
  experiment with new crop lines as there can be significant discrepancies in
  temperature between the highest and lowest levels. We weren't completely
  sure if we believed that, but they were very impressive.

  We tried to get another collectivo back to Cusco, but the driver we followed
  took us to an SUV. We were a bit suspicious, but three other people got in
  soon after us and the price was only one sol more than our bus to Urubamba.
  We listened to The Way of Kings on the way back and luckily enough the driver
  didn't even try and rob us.

  We had a snack of a couple of churros (the large, dulce de leche filled
  version) and listened to a bit more audiobook until it got cold enough to
  force us out of the central square. We had a tapas dinner at the Museo de
  Pisco (a restaurant, not a museum) and a few drinks. Rosie had a particularly
  good pisco sour and was appalled at my pisco, baileys and condensed milk
  cocktail.

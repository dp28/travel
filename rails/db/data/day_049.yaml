  Unfortunately we ended up getting up pretty late. After another recommendation,
  we got breakfast at a Dim Sum place nearby. The food was great; a wide variety
  of things appearing on trolleys, few of which we recognised. We ate quite a bit,
   but, like my time in China, the food is so different that I ended up feeling
   slightly odd and stopped eating before I was full.

  To beat the heat of the day, we took the funicular railway up Penang Hill
  (according to the internet it has the steepest tunnel in the world). There,
  it was a bit cooler, but pretty busy. We went on one of the larger walks, then
  walked down the steep road and paths (at times, 30%) down to the botanical
  gardens at the base of the hill.

  Along the walks, we came across multiple groups of two different types of
  monkey. One set were dark brown with light patches around their eyes, except
  for a tiny, bright orange baby. They were pretty chilled, sitting at the tops of
  trees eating something, with the occasional wild leap between trees. <R> These
  were the nice monkeys and the little ginger one was adorable. </R>

  The other monkeys were quite different. Light grey-brown with a ginger tinge to
  their backs (apart from dark brown babies), they were more interested in people.
  They were normally close to or on the
  ground and let us take photos, but after a while and for no discernible reason
  all became aggressive and ran at us. They stopped just before getting to us, but
  we left the area pretty sharpish. <R> Evil little monkeys. </R>

  Down at the botanics it was pretty hot again. We were tired and hungry, but saw
  our bus pull out of the car park as we arrived. We sprinted to the next stop and
  managed to catch it, only to be told that it was going to wait there for another
  half an hour. Not content to wait, we walked on, got some drinks (they still
  have Vanilla Coke here) and found another bus.

  We had a more expensive dinner - a French-inspired Malaysian restaurant with
  enticing pastries and a great salad. We picked up some of the pastries for
  our breakfast the next day, too.

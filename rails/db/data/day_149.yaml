  Today wasn't particularly eventful - our last truly long distance bus of the
  trip. We got up for 9am, then caught the 11am bus to Lima. We watched Justice
  League and the latest Thor movie on our little seat screens, then were pretty
  bored for the remainder of the eight hour journey.

  Once in Lima, we got a taxi and experienced some of the worst traffic I have
  ever seen, not helped by getting stuck behind a traffic light that was red for
  five minutes. Worse, we didn't make it through the first time it turned green.

  The best bit of the day was our food at the end. It was a Friday night, so the
  first four restaurants we saw were pretty packed, so we ended up at the pizza
  place we'd been to before. Afterwards we had dessert at the kroughnuts place
  beside it. Kroughnuts are a mix between croissants and doughnuts which Rosie
  has wanted to try for a long time. They were good, but not as good as a really
  good doughnut. <R> It was international doughnut day and totally worth it. </R>

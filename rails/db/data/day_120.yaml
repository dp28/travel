  We were up early to get a taxi at 6.30am. Or so we thought - the taxi was
  pretty late and we had a bus to catch, so we had a tense start to the day.

  We did make it to the bus run by Bolivia Hop, the bus company we'll be
  traveling with for the next few weeks. They drove us from La Paz to Copacabana
  on the shore of lake Titicaca with a brief stop for breakfast and another to
  take a ferry across a small part of the lake. <R> It was slightly bizare to
  watch the bus get loaded onto a small barge and slowly moved across the narrow
  gap between the 2 bits of land.

  When we arrived we bumped into Wilson and Sita from our Uyuni trip. They're
  also leaving tomorrow, but not staying in the next couple of places we're
  stopping. We dropped off our stuff at our hostel for the night, then went out
  to find lunch.

  We ended up at an upmarket hotel/restaurant with a view over the bay and the
  town. The main reason we went was for the promise of cheese fondue, which did
  not disappoint. We then slowly walked up the hill behind the town, feeling the
  altitude with every step.

  We spent most of the afternoon on a rooftop terrace near the water writing
  postcards. We got them free with the last set of stamps we bought, so they
  were all from Indonesia. We retreated back to our hostel after we finished
  writing and it began to get cold.

  We had dinner at one of the more highly recommended places in the town. I had
  fajitas with brilliant refried beans. Rosie had traditional trout from the
  lake, which is one of the specialities of the town. <R> It was delicious. </R>

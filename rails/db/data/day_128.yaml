  We had one day in Cusco before our 5 day trek (starting tomorrow). We'd booked
  where we were staying for the two nights before and the night after the trek,
  so were pretty disappointed to discover that the showers didn't heat up much
  higher than lukewarm ...

  We walked to the office of our trek organisers (Llama Path), searching for
  ATMs on the way to get money out to pay for it. Unfortunately, most ATMs seem
  to limit each card to 400 soles ($120/£90) withdrawal per day, so we were
  forced to dip into our emergency US dollars to pay for part of the trek.
  Grumble.

  ~~The main reason Rosie wanted to come back to Peru was to go back to Los
  Perros restaurant.~~ <R> Not true, but it is a good restaraunt. </R>
  From her previous visits to Cusco, Rosie knew of a great
  restaurant called Los Perros near the centre, so we headed there for lunch.
  We had wantons, potato skins and yuca with a variety of dips, including a
  spectacular guacamole, and a pumpkin soup. It lived up to all of Rosie's
  earlier praise.

  We then had a bit of a wander around Cusco, not really looking for major
  attractions as we knew we'd have time to see them after the trek. We saw some
  of the impressive Incan walls built from huge blocks of granite carved to fit
  exactly together without mortar.

  The best discovery on our wanderings was a small chocolate museum where we
  were given plenty of tastings, including a sample of a fantastic 70% dark
  chocolate. We booked a chocolate workshop with them for when we get back in a
  week's time. I'm already looking forward to it.

  We went back to the hotel to finalise some planning before the trek and to try
  and get the diary up to date (and almost succeeding - only today ended up
  being written after the trek). Then we had a briefing at Llama Path, running
  through the itinerary, introducing the group (or at least the 8 out of 12 who
  were there) and the main guide, Jose. We also were given a bright red
  drawstring bag each in which we could put 5kg of kit to be carried by horses
  or porters during the trek. <R> Jose was interesting, we'll see how thats goes. </R>

  We made our way back to the hotel, buying a pair of walking poles for me (to
  reduce knee problems) and getting a decent dinner overlooking the Plaza de
  Armas. We loaded up on trekking snacks and packed our bags, ready for our
  early morning start.

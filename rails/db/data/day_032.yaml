  This was probably our longest bus journey yet, starting just after 7.30am and
  arriving just before 5pm with a half an hour stop for lunch. Not too much to
  report, really - just a lot of road and a few slightly hairy moments as the bus
  had to leave the tarmac every so often.

  We arrived in Siem Reap and walked to our hotel, pleased to discover that our
  room was bigger than our standard box and reasonably cool. We searched for
  somewhere for dinner and headed to one that Rosie found serving twists on local
  food. On the way, we saw the silhouettes of giant bats, flying foxes, in the air
  above us. The food was pretty good, especially the prahok - a fermented fish
  paste in this case used in a thick sauce with shrimp and pork, served with rice
  crackers.

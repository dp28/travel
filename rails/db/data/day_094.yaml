  Still a bit tired after our bus sleep, we arrived in Mendoza in the mid
  morning. We walked into town, finding our hostel. We had a small private room
  with squeaky bunkbeds. We'd not eaten much on the bus and had lunch at a
  vegetarian pay-by-weight buffet, which seem to be popular (although normally
  with meat). Rosie loaded up with tea at the nearest Starbucks, too. <R> I just
  really needed a proper cup of tea. </R>

  It's a bit cooler here than it's been so far, so we walked to the various
  parks here. The centre of the city is a large, square park, surrounded by
  four smaller parks separated by a block or two on each corner. We sat in the
  larger central park for a while before moving on. We made our way out to the
  much larger San Martin park, spending some time by the lake watching a tiny
  dog try and catch pigeons.

  On our way back into town we stopped to book a wine tour for the next day and
  have a look in a chocolate shop or two. We were stopped by a man in the centre
  of a street as we were all crossing it - he just seemed to want to have a
  brief conversation about when he was an artist in London.

  After a quick shower, we found a decent Italian place for dinner. At 8.30pm,
  we were the second group of people to sit down in the restaurant. Our food was
  good (more melt-in-the-mouth gnocchi for me), but, knowing that we were going
  wine tasting the next day, we didn't order any wine. We still had a taste of
  some as part of a promotion by a local winery in combination with the
  restaurant.

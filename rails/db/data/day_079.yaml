  Our hotel provided a pretty big and decent breakfast this morning. Rosie
  wasn't forced to eat banana pancakes, which is probably a plus. We had a boat
  to catch, but at 11am, so didn't need to get off too early.

  We packed up and walked down to the port town, really feeling the heat with
  rucksacks on our backs and fronts. At the boat we were told to go to the
  office to get the ticket for our booking. At the office, we were told to go to
  another office, who gave us one set of tickets then brought us to the first
  office to exchange the tickets for another set of tickets, then sent us back
  to the boat. According to the sign on the second office, it was a "one stop
  shop" ... <R> Sigh </R>

  The boat took about 90 minutes to get to the first of the Gili islands, our
  destination. There we waited for people to get on and off before heading to
  Gili Meno, the smaller, quieter island that we're staying on. The boat was
  reasonable and was showing the remake of The Karate Kid quietly, but
  subtitled, on mulltiple screens. However, the film was paused at the first
  island and never resumed. It happened to pause right at the start of the final
  fight of the film, a really frustrating place to leave it. Ah well.

  We got onto a small barge with our luggage, then took off our shoes to wade
  into shore. Despite being located in the centre of the island, our hotel was
  less than ten minutes' walk away - the island is only about 2km by 1km. There
  are no motor vehicles, just a few bicycles and horses and carts.

  Our hotel was great - A/C, fan, (possibly working) safe, fridge, lots of free
  drinking water, private bathroom and patio, free tea and coffee and a
  delicious dragonfruit shake welcome drink. We dropped of our stuff and headed
  back to the beach we'd arrived at for a small lunch and to organise some
  diving for tomorrow.

  Just after we'd suncreamed up ready to go snorkeling it started to rain. We
  walked back in the direction of our room and the rain petered out. We
  continued on o the other side of the island, but the wind had picked up,
  making the sea too rough for snorkeling to be worth it. The waves also weren't
  big enough for surfing, so we lay on the beach reading for a bit before having
  a brief dip, finding out just how shallow the water was.

  After showering, we got back to the beach in time for a spectacular sunset
  where the sun fell behind Gunung Agung, Bali's tallest volcano (the one which
  caused quite a bit of disruption a few months ago). We slowly walked north
  along the beach and found somewhere reasonable for dinner (a better pizza than
  lunch).

  The breakfast at our hotel was **huge**, including bowls of tea and hot
  chocolate (you can probably guess who had tea and who had chocolate).

  We took a taxi up the road to the "tarabita" - a metal box suspended on a wire
  across a canyon, powered by an old car engine. Along with four or five others,
  we took it across the 150m drop to get to the walking path on the other side.
  We followed the trail to five of the seven nearby waterfalls, avoiding getting
  too wet. None of them were massive, but still picturesque.

  We took the tarabita back, then were offered a lift back down to town by a
  local. Back down the hill we had some arepas for lunch, then made it back to
  the hotel just before the rain really started. Stuck inside, we ended up
  watching several episodes of the crime series Castle (Nathan Fillion is
  great). Once the rain died down enough, we ventured out to find a highly rated
  (but empty) Italian restaurant for dinner, then watched a bit more Castle.

  Due to our late night, we ended up getting up pretty late (10.30am - 11am). We
  had breakfast at a local bakery (cheese and banana sandwiches are popular here),
  then did some trip admin jobs - post a few things, get some laundry done. By
  midday it was **hot** - it's been 34 degrees elsewhere, but I swear it felt
  hotter here. We decided against walking up the hills nearby and instead spent
  the day wandering through Georgetown to see the local street art, both murals
  and wire sculptures.

  Walking around the town showed us how different Malaysia is from the countries
  we've been to so far. For one thing, the roads are filled mainly with cars, not
  scooters, and you are supposed to cross at traffic lights, not just walk blindly
  into the road. Surprisingly, I found myself missing Vietnamese roads - walking
  directly into the road just seems faster and easier.

  Another difference is the language - Vietnamese and Thai are tonal, so were
  very difficult for me to pronounce. Even though Vietnamese used the Latin
  alphabet, it had plenty of additional symbols to indicate tones. Malay isn't
  tonal, uses the Latin alphabet, is pronounced the way it is written and has many
  familiar words, eg "restoran" is restaurant.

  A further difference is the money. So far, all the denominations have been
  pretty huge, eg in Vietnam the smallest note is 1,000 dong and we'd spend over
  a million a day. Malaysian ringgit are only four to the dollar, so we're back
  to having ones and tens. <R> There are even a couple of coins, although i think
  the smallest denomination is 5 sent. </R>

  Anyway, back to the day at hand, we followed another recommendation from our
  hotel and went to the snake temple for the evening. As part of Chinese New Year
  they had a festival with some sore of fire display later on that night. The
  temple itself does have live snakes living in it, some hanging on wire circles
  on the columns inside (above head height), others in a walled garden outside.
  The internet assured us that "most of them have been defanged".

  We indulged at the various food stalls, trying a variety of (mainly deep fried)
  foods, then sat to watch the main stage. At 7.30pm, people started giving
  speeches, thanking everyone involved in the organisation. 45 minutes and four
  speakers later, after everyone involved and all the attending politicians had
  been thanked sufficiently in Chinese and English, some performances started.
  There were drummers, several singers and multiple groups of dancers. The most
  impressive were a group with a very long, thin paper-like dragon suspended
  above them on poles. They rotated the poles while walking, making the dragon
  appear to swirl through the air. At times they would have to jump over the
  dragon in a staggered line.

  After several hours, around 9pm, we decided waiting until midnight was going to
  be too much. We had a bit more of a look around. We saw some more dragon
  dancers, this time in large dragon costumes covering two people each, pretending
  to fight on raised platforms and throwing oranges to the crowd. We saw several
  gymnasts, one specialising in balancing things on sticks held between his teeth,
  eg catching basketballs thrown by the crowd on this stick, then holding a spoon
  in his mouth with a spatula spinning on it with a bowl spinning on the spatula.
  Ridiculous, but impressive.

  As we left, it began to rain. By the time we found shelter, it was torrential.
  We were glad to have left when we did, as in the few seconds it took to get into
  the Grab car we ordered we were close to soaked. <R> P.S. Places that offer
  free internet with no password, you're the best. </R>

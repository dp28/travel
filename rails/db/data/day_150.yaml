  Our room in our hotel was right beside the always-locked outer door to the
  premises, which meant that until around 3am people would knock loudly to be
  let in. Despite this, we managed some half-decent sleep.

  We had breakfast in the hotel, then planned our short time in Lima (starting
  with laundry ... last time for the trip!). We found a great looking, but
  surprisingly empty restaurant that served brunch where I had a huge feijoada
  (a black bean stew) and Rosie had beef eggs Benedict.

  One of the attractions near by was a park with a population of around 60 cats.

  I'm not sure how they ended up there originally, but there's now a charity
  that looks after them. Rosie got some tea while I opted for picarones -
  traditional doughnuts made from sweet potatoes. We then went back to the hotel
  to phone home and get the diary caught up after our trek.

  In the evening we visited as many alpaca-wool clothes shops as we could find,
  looking for a jumper with a very specific weave. Having almost given up hope,
  we somehow managed to find what we were looking for in the second last shop
  we knew of. We celebrated with a pisco sour each, our last in peru.

  We returned to the same restaurant that we'd been to for brunh for dinner.
  They had a nine course tasting menu with a mix of traditional food that we'd
  had before and enjoyed (eg ceviche) among other dishes that we hadn't tasted.
  It was a great way to finish Peru (this time, at least).

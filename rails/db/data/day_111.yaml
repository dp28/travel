  Surprisingly, despite sleeping at nearly 4,000m we slept really well. We had
  pancakes with dulce de le (of course) for breakfast, then brought our stuff
  out to the car.

  After a false start (Leo forgot his phone), we got off for a brief drive,
  stopping at a "rock city" nearby. It was a large formation of volcanic rock,
  probably formed from lava flows. They were fun and easy to climb, so we spent
  a good half an hour there. The other car from the day before had broken down
  again, so we ended up spending a bit more time there, sitting in the shade of
  the rocks.

  Our car took a couple of tries before it started, but it did work eventually.
  We didn't have far to go before stopping to get photos of a camel-shaped rock.
  I don't think the plan had been to be there for long, but unfortunately our
  car wouldn't start again. Luckily, the tour company we went with had three
  other cars which traveled with us. All the drivers crowded around the car's
  hood, then took out the seats in the middle of the car to get at some of the
  electrics. Leo suggested that we walk to another set of rocks nearby, so we
  did. We spent about an hour walking over, climbing up the rocks and listening
  to a bit of the Wheel of Time in the shade. When the six of us decided to
  return to the car it was still a hive of activity. A couple of the drivers
  set up lunch for us while the others worked. Leo returned to last night's
  village to get a part, then came back. He also phoned for a replacement car,
  but finally, thankfully, the car started.

  Back in a working car, we set off in convoy. We probably skipped one or two
  stops originally scheduled for today, but we did still visit a few more
  sights. One was a small marsh within another rocky landscape, grazed by llamas
  and leading to an almost black lagoon. Another was a deep canyon with a
  curving river running through it and precipices out into it that gave a good
  view. There was still a good deal of driving, so we finished the prequel to
  the Wheel of Time part way through the day. The last stop was at a shop that
  sold quinoa beer and cactus beer - according to the people around who actually
  like beer, eg Rosie, the quinoa beer was surprisingly good.

  For the night, we stayed in a salt hotel - a building partly made from salt
  and with salt sculptures on the wall. We had hot showers, a simple but tasty
  three course meal accompanied by wine (and coke). We had an early night due
  to the promise of an early morning and electricity that turned off at 10pm.

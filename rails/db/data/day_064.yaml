  I've let the time run away with me again and I'm writing this six days and two
  countries later in Indonesia ...

  Anyway, this was another traveling day to get back to a major hub (Kuala
  Lumpur) in preparation for a flight the next day. We spent a lot of time on
  a couple of buses, ending up at our hotel a few minutes from the bus to the
  airport.

  We spent what was left of our afternoon washing our clothes at a laundrette
  (hot jungles apparently lead to a lot of dirty, sweaty clothes). This gave us
  time to read and for me to catch up on a few other diary entries.

  The real stand out bit of the day was the food. We (Rosie, mainly) had a
  traditional breakfast of nasi lemak - coconut rice normally with a fried egg
  and sambal (chilli and tomato). It was pretty good, but nothing on dinner.
  Right beside our hotel in KL was a highly-rated South Indian restaurant that
  turned out to be a small chain (called MTR?) from India that had spread to
  Malaysia. The food was incredible. Rosie got a "mini meal", basically two
  types of bread and little dishes of maybe eight curries and a dessert (gulub
  jaman?) that wasn't even part of it on the menu. <R> I love it when restaraunts
  have tasting platter type things like this, especially when they are nice and 
  cheap. </R> I had great savoury lentil
  donuts, mangalore buns (slightly sweet, fluffy, hollow buns made from banana
  and some type of flour), and rava idli (a light, semolina-like cake more
  traditionally made with rice). It was all fantastic and we went to sleep
  stuffed.

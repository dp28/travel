  We were up at 4.30am to get to our pick up spot for 5am, with a quick
  (unsuccessful) attempt to withdraw a bit more soles (Aside: "sol" is
  pronounced "soul", which makes talking about how much things cost amusing -
  "How much is it to use the toilet?" "One soul.").

  We were picked up in a large bright red bus and told that we had a two hour
  drive, so could sleep. Ten minutes later we were herded out of the bus to see
  the porters' accommodation. I'm glad that they are provided for (apparently
  this didn't used to be the case between treks), but I didn't feel the need to
  see it first hand, especially early in the morning when the porter could
  otherwise be sleeping.

  We stopped in a small village for breakfast where we started to get to know
  the rest of the group. There were two other couples - Catriona and Phillipe,
  from the US, and Clare and Andy, from China and Taiwan - and six others -
  Carleigh and Eva from the US, Eric and Stu from Canada, Tom from Germany and
  Frank from Australia.

  After breakfast, we got back on the bus to go to the starting point along with
  a small fleet of other buses. The road became steeper, thinner and very
  windy with fantastic views and sharp drops. We were surrounded by imposing
  mountains with the occassional snow cap in the distance.

  Eventually we reached the start and piled out of the bus, which promptly
  performed an impressive 3-point turn in very little space. We had a fairly
  steep climb to start us off, but quickly reached a tiny channel of water about
  a handspan in width which was apparently an Incan canal. We followed this for
  the next hour and a half, meaning the path was pretty flat. <R> At this point
  Jose started to tell us about the flora, fauna and history of the area. I was
  pretty impressed with his knowledge, right up until he told me that peru had
  given potatoes to the Irish just after WWII because they were hungry. After that
  point I viewed everything he told me with a healthy amount of suspicion. Which
  turned out to be a good view because there were many other interesting
  (read: wrong) facts through out the trip.</R>

  We stopped further up the valley where our tents had already been set up
  beside some small buildings. Someone had a deck of cards and a group of us
  played a couple of hands of President with quite different rules:
  * twos are the highest card
  * you **have** to play higher than the previous card played
  * if you pass once, you can't play until the next round
  * the three of clubs starts
  * if three consecutive cards are played, the last person can say "run" to
    force all following cards to also be consecutive
  * jokers can be played to beat anything (one joker beats a pair or triple)

  We then had lunch, which was fantastic. The food would have been great even if
  I hadn't known it had been prepared in a hut in the middle of nowhere. We had
  three courses: starter, soup and main course, which itself was four separate
  platters. For me the highlight was the starter - a chicken and mango ceviche
  (yes, you read that right, no, the chicken wasn't raw).

  After lunch we (slowly) walked up to a glacial lake at about 4,100m. It was
  just below a glacier topping the nearest mountain and was a deep blue. The
  steep incline gave a lot of us a taste of the altitude and it was a bit of a
  slog. The way down was a lot of quicker, but that may have had something to do
  with the imposing dark clouds making their way up the valley towards us.

  We made it to the huts just before the heavens opened. We were provided with
  hot tea, milo (malted chocolate drink), and salted popcorn. I'd heavily
  recommend salted popcorn covered in milo powder - it's great after a day of
  walking. This was followed by another great meal: soup, four platters and a
  dessert - banana flambe, served **on fire**. Amazing.

  We spent the morning (after another huge breakfast) driving from Santiago to
  Valparaiso, the main port town near(ish) Santiago. Santiago is a gridlike,
  obviously planned and reasonably flat city. Valparaiso is nothing like it.
  It's a sprawling mass of multicoloured buildings flowing over dozens of
  steep hills.

  We stayed in a little hotel perched on top of one of the central hills, hidden
  in a maze of thin one-way streets. Both rooms had small balconies overlooking
  the Pacific, but only one was ready for us, so we left everything in one room
  before leaving to look around the city.

  Valparaiso is incredibly colourful, similar to La Boca in Argentina. Both are
  due to buildings being painted with cheap paint left over from ships. Ships
  are painted with bright colours so that they can be seen, so the city ended
  up bright blues and yellows and greens. In addition to the bright coloured
  walls, Valparaiso has a strong tradition of street art and graffiti. There are
  some very impressive pieces of art dotted around, both large and small. Some
  last for years, others are replaced within months.

  We spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon looking at the art, then
  had a seafood lunch at a restaurant near the harbour. Afterwards we joined a
  walking tour of the city, focusing primarily on the street art, but also
  explaining the importance of the port through the history of Chile (and the
  San Francisco gold rush). We used some of the hundred year old lifts or
  small furnicular railways in the centre of the city to get up the steep hills
  for a token fee.

  After the tour, we rode up another lift to view the modern shipping port,
  watching lorries bring in containers and cranes take containers off a huge
  ship. As it approached dusk, we went back to the hotel, had our complimentary
  welcome drink, then walked to a nearby restaurant with a great view over the
  city and excellent food.

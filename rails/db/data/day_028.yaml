  The day started with a four or five hour bus journey from the peaceful emptiness of Kep to the hive
  of activity that is Phnom Penh. It wasn't bad, pretty similar to our other daytime bus trips,
  unfortunately without free water or snacks.

  We arrived around 2pm, hungry and quickly very hot. We found our hostel, climbed the steep steps to
  our top floor room to stow our bags, then headed out to find lunch. Afterwards, we focused on
  finding a really nice restaurant for tomorrow's dinner - hopefully that will work out tomorrow.
  Along the way, we saw the outside of the royal palace and monuments erected to the previous king and
  independence from France. We also sat on the banks of the Mekong along with crowds of locals
  (it's currently a public holiday), hoping to see the full moon (apparently a supermoon) rise, but
  were thwarted by clouds.

  We ate dinner at a little street food place - fried rice and seafood. It was a bit disappointing,
  though - the smells outside the little foodstalls and tables were much better than the food tasted
  and both dishes (surprisingly) contained baby octopus, which neither of us particularly like. We
  made up for it with pudding and drinks down the road. The avocado milkshake was deliciously smooth,
  with a subtle flavour, almost like drinking cream (not like I'd ever do _that_).

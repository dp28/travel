  We woke up to another cloudy morning, leaving an atmospheric (pardon the pun) fog in the valley
  below the treehouse as it burnt off. We packed up, had another great breakfast (bread and tamarind &
  coconut jam), took a final photo of our treehouse, then headed back down to the village we had
  started at.

  It was another bumpy drive back to the main road, where we stopped for lunch. We found out that a
  couple of other people from our treehouse were also headed to Luang Prabang by overnight bus.
  They'd already taken the bus once and were full of stories about how awful it was. Windy roads,
  a cramped bed shared with another passenger, frequent stops, jammed full with people sleeping in the
  aisle ... but if they were getting it again, it can't have been _that_ bad, can it?

  Back in Huay Xai at the main office, we killed a couple of hours showering, repacking and reading by
  the side of the Mekong river. At 5pm, slightly apprehensive about the night ahead, we got in a
  songthaew to the bus station. The bus was there and apparently different from the sleeping bus we'd
  been told about, possibly better.

  Unfortunately, it wasn't. We both had something between a seat and a bed with seatbelts that didn't
  work and after a huge number of locals piled into the bus we had someone practically sleeping on our
  feet. The driver took off, turning off the lights, but making liberal use of his horn. The road
  wasn't massively windy, but the stops did seem to be located about two minutes before I would
  otherwise have been able to get to sleep. We did, however, manage to finish listening the the third
  last Wheel of Time book. Only about 80 hours to go!

  After another huge breakfast, we decided to go for a swim in the hotel pool.
  We immediately changed our minds after touching the water - nowhere near warm
  enough. Instead, we took our time packing up then checked out and headed
  over to the chocolate cafe to pick up a few more souvenirs. We found a cafe
  with some games to have lunch at and played cards until the bus to Quito
  arrived.

  The bus ride was fairly uneventful as we'd downloaded a couple of episodes of
  Castle for the journey. Unfortunately I managed to lose my only jumper either
  on the bus or somewhere earlier today ...

  After a taxi ride we checked into our hotel in Quito, then headed out to find
  dinner. We ended up in quite a fancy place with interesting, but somewhat
  disappointing, food. I had tongue, which wasn't as good as I remember it and
  Rosie had a balsamic vinegar cocktail. The cocktail wasn't great, primarily
  because it was made from an infused local sugar cane alcohol which we tasted
  later - both the base alcohol and the infusion were pretty unpleasant.

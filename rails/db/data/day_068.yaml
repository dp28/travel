  We hadn't been looking forward to today and weren't really sure why we'd
  arranged it. We wanted to be in Bali for the 16th for a festival, so had a few
  days to kill between now and then. It would probably have made sense just to
  go to Bali early. However, for reasons that we can't really recall, we decided
  to go to Lombok instead. Lombok is another Indonesian island, but further
  **east** of Singapore. Because of that, it's not actually that easy to go from
  Singapore to there. To do so, we ended up with two flights (through Jakarta),
  booked through an agency (Kiwi.com). Despite the airlines being part of the
  same group, it was a self-transfer, so we had to pick up bags in Jakarta, then
  check in for the next flight. <R> Yup, no idea why we did this... </R>

  We had this to look forward to as we got up at 6am. The MRT to the airport
  wasn't busy and neither, really, was the airport for the size of it. The kaya
  toast stand where I got breakfast, however, was heaving - mot helped by the
  guy two ahead of me in the queue who ordered 16 egg tarts.

  The lounge at the gate was pretty comfortable and they even had a David
  Attenborough show on the wildlife of Singapore on the TVs. Unfortunately, the
  flight didn't board until the time it was supposed to take off. Had we been on
  schedule, we'd have had two hours and twenty five minutes to transfer. This
  cut that down by at least half an hour. <R> Starting to panic. </R>

  The flight was fine, but didn't make up any time. Our bags were pretty late
  on the conveyor belt (we've been pretty lucky normally), but immigration was
  pretty quick. Then we faced the organisation of Jakarta airport.

  Jakarta airport has three terminals. We landed in terminal 2 and needed to
  get to terminal 1. There didn't seem to be any signs, but an official
  pointed us to the skytrain. This is outside the building and not as frequent
  as we would have liked - every 15 minutes in each direction, and we **just**
  missed one. <R> Actually panicing now. </R>  Twenty five minutes later we were at terminal 1, or rather
  terminal 1B. Our tickets didn't say which part of terminal 1 we needed. We
  tried to go in, but were told to go to terminal 1C, a few minutes' trolley-run
  behind us. <R> AHHHHHH!!! </R>

  At terminal 1C, we had to through some bag-scanning security just to get in.
  We were divided by gender here, which hasn't really happened to us at airports
  before. Once inside, we found the shortest queue as there was now less than an
  hour until our flight left. Several flights around hours were boarding, but
  when Rosie talked to the guy shouting "Lombok!" he just pointed to go back to
  our line. Eventually, someone realised we needed to get through quickly and
  so the woman at the desk processed us alongside the two guys ahead of us,
  taking our passports, running out of the departure hall and returing with
  boarding passes (maybe her printer was out of paper? Not sure). <R> By this
  point we were somewhere between very nervous and very fed up. It often feels
  like no one in SEA really knows what is going on. </R>

  We ran out of the departure hall, taking the escalator steps two at a time.
  There was more security, so we were separated by gender again, then got
  through to an area with a few shops, but far less than outside the departure
  hall. We rushed to our gate lounge, only to sit there for at least twenty
  minutes. The time for our flight to leave came and went while the board
  stubbrnly insisted our flight was "on schedule". At least we didn't have
  another connection. This was the only place we'd had time to consider lunch,
  but there was only a tiny little shop. The smells earlier of the Rotiboy
  bakeries had been so enticing as we'd run past, but the chocolate bun I bought
  didn't live up to them at all.

  The flight, once we got on it, was surprisingly good. It was only 110 minutes,
  but we got a reasonable meal and entertainment - I hadn't seen Antz in years.

  We got to Lombok and realised pretty quickly we were a world away from
  Singapore, back to hundreds of people asking you if you want a taxi every time
  you take a step. We managed, despite the internet failing, to get a Grab car
  from just outside the airport (probably because of taxi drivers preventing
  Grab drivers coming there - I've herad of it elsewhere). As we drove
  through Lombok the differences from Singapore were stark - tiny, relatively
  ramshackle buildings and much poorer infrastructure. Our driver stopped to try
  and buy drinking water, which would be unnecessary in Singapore as the tap
  water is safe to drink. There were far more scooters on the road and we passed
  a substantial accident where a digger had crashed on corner.

  Unlike most Grab drivers, our driver was pretty chatty - at least, to me. He
  didn't ever try and engage Rosie in conversation, only ever asking me
  questions about her. I assumed this was due to the fact that we're now in the
  largest Islamic country in the world, but it was still pretty weird. <R> This
  did nothing to improve my mood. I am all for differences in culture but I did
  not appriciate being ignored in this way. It is rude. </R>


  We arrived at quite a nice guest house with a surprisingly big room, complete
  with a little veranda. We headed into town (Kuta) for dinner, expecting the
  same as in smaller tourist towns - plenty of restaurants, not much variety.
  However, it seems like we've done well here, to the point that we're spoilt
  for choice. As well as the ever-present burgers and pizza, there's
  great-looking Mediterranean food, crepes, galletes, local food, and more. I
  had a really good local fried rice (or nasi goreng here) while Rosie continued
  to check out the satay. <R> Guys peanut sauce is the best! </R>

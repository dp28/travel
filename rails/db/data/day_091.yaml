  The jet lag really hit us today. We probably went to sleep at about 11pm last
  night, but woke up at 12.20pm today. <R> Whoops! </R> Our hotel breakfast ended at 11.30am and
  our plan had been to go on another walking tour at 11.30am, so we'd managed to
  mess up both of those plans. Luckily, the hotel staff gave us some breakfast
  anyway, which was really good of them.

  One of the main things that seems to be recommended to do in Buenos Aires is
  to walk around a cemetery in the Recoleta, despite how morbid that seems. We
  tried to get the bus there, which is really cheap, but after 25 minutes at a
  crawl, we got out and walked. Of course, after two minutes, the traffic
  dissipated and the bus zoomed past us.

  The cemetery feels like a town itself, with gridlike streets lined with
  mausoleums. Like the palacios yesterday, most date to about a century ago
  during the "golden age". Some are works of art, with statues, engraved rock
  and stained glass windows meant to be viewed from inside the mausoleums.

  The most celebrated tomb there is somewhat understated. Evita, or Eva Peron,
  is still massively famous here despite dying in 1952. Part of that presumably
  is because of the disappearance of her corpse during one of Argentina's
  military regimes. The military overthrew her husband's government and outlawed
  Peronism, making it a crime even to speak his or her name. After more than a
  decade, it turned out that the military government had buried her in Italy.
  Her body was returned to her husband, then in Spain with his third wife, who
  apparently displayed the body in his dining room near the table. Due to a
  popular protest (involving stealing another corpse), her body was eventually
  returned to Argentina, where it is now buried. <R> As bizzare and complicated
  as this story sounds there is actually more to it including a doctor who was
  at one point in charge of looking after the body of Evita untill it was discovered
  that he was in love with Evita, and acting accordingly. </R>

  We had a decent lunch (with some great cakes), then went to look at the Pink
  House, effectively Argentina's White House, except in the city. Unfortunately,
  there was a lot of construction work going on in he square in front of it,
  plus there's a massive fence in front of it, so we didn't get that great a
  view.

  We spent the evening booking the next stage of our trip from our hotel. We
  went to a highly-recommended empanada place and had four empanadas and some
  falafel tacos (I think they **could** be great, they just weren't here).

  We finished off the night at a milonga - an Argentinian tango night. We
  arrived as a tango lesson was finishing, then watched people dance and
  listened to a band perform. Rosie had some red wine while I tried Fernet, a
  local herbal liquor kind of like Jaegermeister, but with a less pleasant
  flavour (I wouldn't recommended it). The tango performers who finished the
  night were fantastic, using the entire stage, rarely opening their eyes
  and executing some impressive spins. <R> Daniel wouldn't dance with me :( </R>

  <R> P.S. For some reason I took mainly video today thus the lack of photos,
  sorry. </R>

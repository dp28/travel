  Today was a lazy day. Rosie wasn't feeling that great and neither of us were
  particularly enamoured with the few sites nearby that seemed to be open at the
  weekend. We took the opportunity to have a bit of a rest day - finally getting
  this diary up to date. We also revisted an old classic, downloading a GameBoy
  emulater to my phone to play a Pokemon game we both knew. Great day.

  (If you're reading this, happy birthday Katie!)

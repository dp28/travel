  On our last day in Arequipa we didn't have to much left that we wanted to do
  that we hadn't already done. We spent the morning using the hostel's wifi - so
  I could do a bit more programming and Rosie could do a bit of prep for a call
  with her lab in Edinburgh in the next few days. We had the leftovers of
  Rosie's lasagne from last night for lunch.

  After lunch, we headed out to get Rosie a SIM card as her previous one still
  hasn't activated. This time it was a much easier process and the card was
  activated immediately.

  We continued on into town, returning to Mundo Alpaca (Aplpaca World), stopping
  in a small park to have a few pastries. We met the alpacas again  <R> they are
  just so fluffy and adorable </R> and Rosie got
  herself an alpaca jumper (50% off). We shopped for a few more souvenirs on the
  way back to the hotel, returning to the internet.

  We had dinner at a restaurant Rosie had been to before called Zig Zag. I had
  one of its specialities - three hunks of meat (beef, alpaca and pork) served
  sizzling on a volcanic rock. The alpaca was the most flavoursome and juiciest.
  They also offered small chocolate truffles as a dessert, which I appreciated.

  Back at the hotel, we published our work for the day - my programming and
  Rosie's latest video of our trip - then packed to leave tomorrow.

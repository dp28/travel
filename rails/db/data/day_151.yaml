  Unfortunately the proximity of our room to the road meant that we didn't get
  much sleep this time. We were up at 6.45am anyway to catch a bus for the
  airport and ended up jumping onto a little collectivo, which was really cheap
  and dropped us off across the road from the airport. We checked in, grabbed
  some breakfast, made it through immigration, then got on our plane.

  We'd been somewhat skeptical of our flight time - 10.32am seemed overly
  specific. However, the plane did actually leave the gate at exactly 10.32am.
  The flight was only a couple of hours, meaning that I missed the last 15
  minutes of the film I chose (LBJ). For some reason it was also one of the
  bumpiest flights we've had, particularly from side to side.

  In Quito, we got a taxi straight to the bus station, then immediately caught
  a bus to Mindo. We slept a bit on the bus and arrived in Mindo two hours
  later.

  Mindo is lower than Quito, only around 1,500m, and surrounded by cloud forest.
  It's a small town and not that nice by itself, but with great scenery. We
  dropped off our bags at our hotel, then turned around and headed back towards
  the town.

  I'd noticed that one of the main things in Mindo was a small-scale chocolate
  producers. We joined one other guy on a tour of their place, seeing cacao
  growing, fermenting and drying, along with the machinery to turn it into
  chocolate. We tasted several of their chocolates and chocolate products,
  including a delicious brownie and "cacao honey" made from the white flesh
  that surrounds the cacao beans in the pod. Rosie bought some of the honey and
  some cacao tea while I got some heavily-recommended fudge (more chocolate than
  fudge, really).

  We had dinner at a little organic cafe with a set menu which turned out to be
  huge. To Rosie's delight, the young family next to us had a big, friendly dog
  which begged us both (unsuccessfully) for scraps. Afterwards, back at the
  hotel, the internet was actually good so we watched a few Sorted videos before
  sleep.

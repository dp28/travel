  We were up in time for the end of breakfast (10am), then spent the rest of the
  morning on the telefericos. They give great views of the city and we hadn't
  been on all of them yesterday. The two extra we went on today (the white line
  and orange line) were the best - one just above a main road, the other going
  up and over a large hill. We decided they'd make a great focal point of an
  opening chase scene of a Bond film and spent a while trying to work out how
  it should play out.

  Once we got hungry, we got off the cable cars and found a few different places
  to get some delicious baked goods for lunch. Because it was nearby, we then
  took a tour of the St Francis museum which, as far as we could tell from the
  guide, is still a functioning Fransiscan convent. The church also incorporates
  indigenous art including depictions of their deities. The view from the roof
  wasn't as spectacular as you'd expect for a large church because it's located
  almost at the bottom of the bowl of the city.

  We spent the afternoon shopping somewhat successfully for souvenirs, then
  less successfully going to a museum. It was shut, and not just for the two and
  a half hour lunch break everyone has here. We headed back to the hotel and got
  in a little bit of Pokemon before dinner.

  Dinner had been bokked by Rosie weeks ago. It was a vegan restaurant that only
  offered tasting menus - we opted for the seven course version and shared the
  paired drinks (some wine, a couple of cocktails and a beer). The food was
  primarily made from Bolivian ingredients - lots of corn, potatoes and quinoa.
  It was interesting, but definitely not replicable, and I wasn't overly full
  at the end. Unfortunately for Rosie, both deserts involved bananas (the
  strawberry and banana sorbet was fantastic). We also happened to bump into
  Caitlin and Didi from our Uyuni tour there, too.

  We got up pretty late (about 10am) this morning to try and catch up on sleep.
  It didn't work very well as the room was pretty warm despite the fan.
  Breakfast was included in our guest house and, after ordering, it turned out
  to be served on our veranda outside our room. <R> The people who ran the guest 
  house were lovely although the breakfast was somewhat sad. </R>

  Afterwards, we headed into town with the intention of going surfing, which is
  the main thing to do here. Or rather, near to here. It became clear after
  talking to a few surf schools that all the appropriate places were half an
  hour away by scooter. As we've never ridden a scooter, we're not overly keen
  at learning on these roads with a surfboard strapped to the side of the bike.
  We ended up booking a lesson for tomorrow, including transport. That left us
  with an unexpected afternoon.

  There is a beach here, just without any waves. We spent the rest of the
  morning on the beach, slowly walking along it. The sand was presumably made
  from coral, meaning it was really sharp in some places and quite large in
  others, like millions of mustard seeds. When we went into the water the sand
  gave way easily so we sank into it down to our ankles. <R> We did have a 
  lovely swim though, the water was nice and warm. </R>

  Dark clouds were visible in front of us as we left the beach. We made it into
  a restaurant before any serious rain started and had another delicious meal.
  I spent the rest of the afternoon catching up with this diary while Rosie
  worked on the video of Malaysia. We went to another restaurant we'd seen with
  great Mediterranean food which lived up to our hopes. <R> The food was all 
  surpisingly amazing in Lombok, especially for such a small tourist town. </R>

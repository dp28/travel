  No lemon meringue pie this morning - it was replaced with an interesting
  raspberry pie. After that, Rosie and I booked our onwards tour into Bolivia
  from a tour operator in town, then we got in the car and the four of us drove
  to the Tatio geysers.

  The geysers are an hour or two from San Pedro de Atacama and up at around
  4,300m. Almost all of the tours aim to get there at dawn for the better light
  and the increased activity, but also meant that by arriving around noon we
  avoided the crowds. In fact, a whole caravan of 10-15 minivans and 4x4s came
  past us on their way back as we made our way there.

  The geysers were small, but continuously boiling patches of water with plumes
  of steam reaching metres above them. There were quite a few dotted around the
  place and a hot spring fed pool which we took advantage of after lunch. In the
  pool, we met three Chilean ladies (who live in Argentina, meaning their
  Spanish was very hard to understand). They had big balls of mud and encouraged
  us to rub it on our faces and shoulders. Afterwards, they broke into a couple
  of Beatles' songs. <R> They were great, not sure about the mud though. </R>

  On the way back, we stopped at the Valley of the Dead, also known as Mars
  Valley, just beside the Valley of the Moon. It got one of its names from the
  fact that a Mars rover had been tested in it as it has a comparable landscape.
  We drove into the valley, parking on the sand and walking up onto a plateau
  with a view down onto spiky volcanic hills and the massive sand dune we
  eventually ran down to get back to the car.

  We'd booked an AirBnB for our last day in San Pedro after Rosie's parents had
  left, but for some reason the guy renting it out refused to tell us the
  address. We needed to know it so we could arrange our onward transport, so
  tried to get him to tell us it until he cancelled. Very strange. We found a
  cheap hostel anyway.

  We also moved into a different hotel, more of a resort than the previous one
  with separate buildings for each room, slightly out of town. We bought a
  couple of bags to make it easier to give some of our stuff to Rosie's parents
  to take back. We had another good dinner, finishing with a chanar cake, made
  from a local plant which can be used to produce a sweet flavour.

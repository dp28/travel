  <R> Nothing had quite dried when we woke before the sun (5:50am) with the hope
  of seeing the sunrise over the tea plantations. As such I put on slightly wet
  trousers and slightly wet shoes and packed a slightly wet coat into a slightly
  wet backpack. Our guide picked us up outside our </R> (slightly wet) <R>
  hotel and manged to strike a difficult balance of being enthusiastic about the
  morning to come without being so chipper as to be annoying. I was impressed,
  it’s a hard balance to achieve.

  He drove us in a slightly beaten up Landrover (in British green no less) up a
  fairly bumpy to a view point where we waited in the steadily retreating darkness
  hoping that the clouds would lift and we would get to see the sun. According to
  Appu (the guide) it’s pretty much impossible to predict if you will see the
  sunrise or not but he showed us some pictures of it and it looked incredible.
  Apparently, what you need is for it to rain hard for 15 minutes and then the
  clouds will lift and your lost sleep will not be in vain. Unfortunately for us
  a light misting was all we got and the sun rose without ever showing itself
  behind the clouds. As we returned to town we got to talking to Appu who told us
  that he considered himself Indian despite being third generation Malaysian.
  Apparently the three cultures (the Malay, the Chinese and the Indian
  populations) are fairly segregated in everyday life having different traditions,
  different languages and even different schools. I found this particularly
  interesting given that even though I was born to British parents and have lived
  in the UK for 30% of my life I wouldn’t wholly consider myself British while
  this man who has never lived in India, born to parents who have never lived in
  India considers himself Indian.

  Appu dropped us off a great place to get some breakfast after which we were
  picked up by another guide Kali who had a white Landrover this time. After being
  on a couple of disappointing guided tours we once again had been reluctant to
  sign up for this one but you can’t get 340 5 stars reviews on TripAdvisor
  without being somewhat decent and Kali exceeded all expectations. He first took
  us to the </R> (Scottish-owned) <R> BOH tea plantation where he explained the
  process of making the 4 different types of tea (Black, Chinese, Green, and
  White). The process goes as follows:

  Black, Chinese, and Green tea:

  * The top layer of leaves are picked, this used to be done by hand but is now done by a machine
  * These leaves are dried for 48 hours which mainly removes the moisture on the outside of the leaves
  * The leaves are then rolled to break up the leaves and remove the stalks and stems, again this used to be done by hand but is now done by a machine, the machine at this particular factory was made in Belfast which we found amusing
  * The leaves are then left to oxidize on aluminium trays for different amounts of time
    * Black tea is left for 3 hours
    * Chinese tea is left for 1 hour
    * Green tea is not oxidized
  * The leaves are then further dried and are sorted by size for packaging
  * The smaller leaves go into tea bags and the larger leaves are used for loose leaf tea or pyramid tea bags.
  * The leaves are put in big bags and left for a further 6 months before being packaged and sold

  White tea is made the same way as green tea but is made only from the tips of
  the plant and thus is picked by hand and is very expensive.

  After our factory tour, we were left alone so that we could taste the tea. Dan
  and I got one cup each of their specialty teas the Palas supreme and the Palas
  Afternoon blend. They were both pretty good although the afternoon blend was
  lighter and had less tannins in it, after the disappointment of yesterday’s tea
  plantation tea I was very happy with this.

  We then headed up to the mossy forest which is oldest highland rainforest in the
  world. However first we had to sit in some traffic while two buses tried to pass
  each other on a road that two cars would only just fit on. It was interesting to
  say the least. To get the mossy forest involved a fairly bumpy ride up some
  incredibly steep inclines and I was very glad that we were in a Landrover,
  especially when the road disappeared completely or we had to pass someone and
  thus drive into the ditch on the side of the road. I was both impressed and
  slightly concerned for all the people who tried to do the same drive in their
  little protons and Hondas but we didn’t see anyone stuck so maybe it wasn’t
  as difficult as it looked.

  At the mossy forest Kali really showed his knowledge of plants showing us which
  would kill you, which were endangered, and which would make you fall in love, at
  least according to local legend. He also informed us that most of the moss in
  the mossy forest was actually liverwort which is more closely related to
  seaweed. He also rather astutely pointed out that people would be less inclined
  to visit the liverwort forest.

  After the mossy forest we headed back down the crazy roads but missed out on the
  opportunity to visit the strawberry farms due to the traffic of the main roads.
  As it was a Saturday the local market was in full force and had spilled out onto
  the roadway forcing the traffic system to be one way and thus slowing the
  traffic dramatically. After a pretty good lunch of Indian food, which seems to
  be most of what’s on offer, we climbed into the long-distance bus to Kuala
  Lumpur.

  The bus was totally uneventful although it was 30 minutes early in to KL which
  is almost unheard of in SEA. The buses as a general rule so far have been no
  earlier than 30 minutes late so we were quite surprised when this one pulled up
  at 7:00pm. After a quick but sweaty walk, we arrived at our hotel and were shown
  to yet another box-like hotel room. We dropped our stuff and went out to find
  dinner (yet more Indian food) and ended up with a Dosai bigger than my head.
  After dinner and a quick shower we settled in for an early night in anticipation
  of our 4:00am wake up tomorrow to catch a 7:30am flight to Borneo. </R>

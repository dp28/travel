  Still somewhat tired from the walk yesterday, we had a bit of a lie in. We used the rest of the morning by going for a few small walks along the board walks by the resort. At the start of the first one we heard a slithering in the dried leaves and saw a thin black snake make its way away from the path.
  In the afternoon we went on a "rapid shooting" tour, which basically meant getting in one of the long, thin boats we'd arrived in and going straight through the rapids up river, getting thoroughly soaked in the process. At the first set of rapids, however, the propellor hit a rock and the engine stopped. The boat floated downstream and the driver and the guy at the front of the boat both jumped out and swam the boat closer to shore. The guy at the front held it where he could stand while the other guy fixed the problem. It started to rain, but after five minutes or so we were off and successfully navigated the rapids. <R> Daniel is down playing this. There was a really loud clunk and then the motor stoped and we started floating backwards down river at really quite an impressive speed. The guide at the front then splashed out and kicked us into a backwater while the guy at the back started pounding on the motor, presumably fixing the propellor. </R>
  By this point, the rain was at full force. Even if we hadn't had waves occasionally soaking us, we would have been drenched in minutes. As we'd expected to get wet, it was pretty enjoyable. <R> It was great, I love it when it rains and you were already planning on getting wet. </R>
  The boat stopped beside a small village so that the other tourists with us could go and se the Orang Asli (aboriginal people). We'd opted not to as we hadn't enjoyed similar things in the past, we know the money doesn't really go to them and that, if not for tourist money, they're traditionally nomadic. Instead, we swam in the river which was noticeably warmer than the rain. Unfortunately, that seems to have killed my watch, despite claiming to be water resistant to 100m and dealing with worse submersion before. Damn.
  Back in Kuala Tahan, we showered, dried and I caught up on this diary (a bit). After dinner, we went for our own night walk. We weren't quite as good as our guide, but saw plenty of spiders, a rat, a mouse, a frog, and several porcupines, but sadly no fireflies.
  Back at the guest house we saw our final creature of the forest - a leech attached to my neck. I have no idea how it had gotten there. Apparently 15% DEET (the highest you can buy here) wasn't a strong enough **deet**erent. <R> To be fair to the leech, and the DEET, there is a chance that Daniel missed spaying that particuar bit of skin as it was very near the neck line. How it got on to his neck though is anyones guess, they can't really climb. </R> After removing (and flushing) the leech, wecould see it was just a small cut, but it bled a lot. Leeches apply an anticoagulant to stop blood clots, so I significantly bled through my first plaster. A makeshift absorbant pad of toilet paper micropore-taped to my neck worked much better.

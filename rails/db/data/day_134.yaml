  Hotels and hostels in Machu Picchu town all seem to set their check out times
  at 9am. This still felt like a lie in after our string of early mornings.

  We packed up, then had a disappointing breakfast in the centre of the town. <R>
  mine was good </R> We spent a bit of time in the main square, then wrote some
  postcards in a French boulangerie in between a few pastries (making up for
  breakfast).

  We picked up our luggage before heading to the train station where we met
  Eric. We were in different carriages, however, so only saw him briefly. The
  train had some great views and even had a small snack part way through. Rosie
  remembered a strange show on the train, but (possibly luckily) we didn't get
  one.

  The train didn't go all the way to Cusco, so we got out and onto a huge bus,
  despite the fact that there were only six of us. After a couple of hours we
  transfered into a minibus, then were dropped off at our hostel (eventually -
  there was some sort of festival and terrible traffic).

  We met up with half of our group from the trek at Los Perros and had an
  excellent meal, if somewhat slow to arrive. Most people were leaving the next
  day, so that meal was goodbye.
